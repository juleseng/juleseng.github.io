            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The L Taraval train was running late and I was shivering to death in my tiny skirt. Summer days would have been warm anywhere else, but San Francisco always did its own thing. The fog was thick, the wind was cold, and my legs were littered with goosebumps.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was on my way downtown to meet with Clover and Irma. The three of us hung out because we liked to do this thing where we tried on all the clothes we couldn’t afford, then stuffed the untagged pieces down our bras. It had started to get boring though, in the way that all things did if you kept on them for too long, but we hadn’t found our next fixation yet.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">We met at Dolores Park, which was warmer than the fog-prone Sunset District where I lived. The sun peeked through the clouds and the wind gently kissed our skin. Different types of people gathered to lounge around Dolores: the techy millennials on their eight breaks of the day, the old bongo-playing hippies, and always kids around our age, some of whom Clover could recognize. She was well-known like that and I felt some sort of pride for being one of her closest friends. The grass felt damp to the touch so we laid out our jackets to sit on and lit a blunt with Clover’s leftover weed.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I can’t believe sophomore year is over,” Clover said. She was on her stomach and briefly set a blade of grass ablaze. “It doesn’t feel real.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I’m just glad it’s done,” Irma sighed, picking at her nails. “I almost failed Geometry.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I gave her a look. “Wait, really?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Yeah, I barely passed with a C.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Oh. Wow.” I had taken Geometry in freshman year and gotten an A. Failing a class was a foreign idea to me. I had cried once from getting a B in middle school, even though it hadn’t even counted towards my high school application. But just the thought of being labeled mediocre made me want to vomit. This must have shown in my face because Irma let out a condescending sigh. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I bet you got a 4.0, didn’t you, Ames?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Of course she did.” Clover took a drag of the blunt and handed it to me. “That’s a stupid question.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I inhaled slowly, letting the earthy smoke fill my lungs. “My parents are just strict about grades.” I shrugged, like it was hopeless. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Even though I had said that I knew they’d never understand what it meant to me. My Chinese parents were a different breed. As the children of first-gen immigrants, they still held the traditional values of education, but didn’t care about my connection to any other part of the culture. It was a weird oscillating state to be in because I related to my Asian peers in our parental-induced collective academic trauma, but was at a loss when it came to understanding much about Chinese culture. I felt split in half, not really Asian even though I </span><span class="c6">was</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I thought Irma could relate since she was half-Korean and half-white, but both her parents, who were going through a nasty divorce at the time, seemed to be relatively relaxed about what she did. It wasn't because they were cooler, but because they simply did not care enough. After all, there were other things in their lives that demanded attention. A C on an English paper wouldn’t devastate their family dynamic like it did for mine. So that was that. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Enough about school.” Clover’s blonde waves slinked up as she propped herself up on her forearms. “I’m sick of it.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I hummed in agreement. We all went to Lowell, a magnet public high school, where you had to apply to get in. Most of the people that went there were smart, at least relative to the kids in their old middle schools. The demographics reflected San Francisco. Over half of the kids that went there were Asian and the rest were smart white students who couldn’t afford private school. I never got along with any of the Asian crowds since I was too “white” for them but wasn’t quite “white” enough for the popular Caucasian kids who sat on the elevated courtyard table, above the rest of the student body. It didn’t matter—my friends and I preferred to sit in the field below the school, listening to indie music on our speaker and watching the freshman get whipped into shape by their P.E. teachers. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Lowell was supposed to attract the best and brightest in the city, but I found this to be false advertising. Clover and Irma weren’t as quick as my old, mostly Asian friends from middle school, who had all gone to shiny private schools—like University or Lick-Wilmerding—where their wealthy immigrant parents paid forty thousand a year for them to get overshadowed by their wealthier white peers.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Once I befriended </span><span class="c6">Clover</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in eighth grade, I suddenly stopped hanging out with them. My old friends and I had been rather close since elementary school, and they were all good kids, well-behaved and kind, but once I became a teenager, they were a bit too prudish to keep my interest. I wanted to go to parties, try alcohol, and rebel against my parents’ breathless expectations, something my former friends looked down on. Their moms spoke with thick accents and they dressed in whatever had been gifted to them by their mainland aunties. They cared about grades, but never spoke up in class. Their thermoses were filled with rice, lap cheong, and bok choy, whereas I brought the local Mexican takeout or lukewarm SpaghettiOs.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">At the time, I thought I was better than them for being more cultured, for being able to talk to the white girls, for defying the quiet Asian girl stereotype. I wore my assimilation like a badge of honor. This was also when I started dying my hair brown to blend in with my new friends. I hated looking like every other Asian girl with pin straight black hair. My sister Gi never felt like this, or at least, I’d like to think so. Almost all of her friends were Asian, first-gen students. My dad would later tell me they all studied together, something that I never did with any of my friends. That’s probably why she ended up at Harvard.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“What time is it?” Irma asked.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I checked my phone. “Almost five.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Oh fuck. I gotta go.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Wait, let me spray you,” Clover said, rustling through her bag.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Clover always brought her perfume bottle to mask the smell. She had gotten in trouble a few weeks earlier for coming home from a smoke session and ended up throwing a ceramic plate at her mother’s head. She wrapped one of the smaller shards in some copper wire and wore it as a necklace. Sometimes Clover </span><span class="c6">scared</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;me. She was a self-diagnosed bipolar, addicted to weed, and a bit depressed, but her parents, who were devout Christians, never really did anything about it. Up until then, at least. I assumed this was because her parents had been like her when they were younger, wild and carefree, especially Clover’s mother who had a nose piercing on her left nostril.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I should head out too,” I said, standing up to brush my legs off. I still felt a bit dizzy from the weed and overdose of cheap perfume. I never really liked the feeling of being high, even though everyone else seemed to depend on it. Rather than make me loose and relaxed, weed made me antsy, but I went along with it because I didn’t want to seem like a goody-two-shoes.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Clover relit the blunt. She wasn’t going anywhere. “Stay safe.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">My parents weren’t back when I got home. They were working late, as always. I had little understanding of what they did on a day-to-day basis—a lot of staring at their computers and wearing ironed, ivory shirts. I didn’t mind their absence too much. After all, it benefited me since they were much too tired and too oblivious to realize where I was spending my summer days and nights.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I craved the freedom that both Clover and Irma seemed to have, the ability to do whatever they wanted without the guilt of sneaking around. Sometimes I almost felt bad about it, but that would quickly fade once a chore or tutoring session was piled onto my schedule. If my parents were at home when I wanted to go out, I would zip up a heavy coat over my crop tops and wipe my eyes clean of any makeup and ask to sleepover at a friend’s, never specifying who. In this bare form and front of innocence, it was hard to say no.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I wasn’t surprised to find Gi just alone in her room, door slightly ajar. A small “Class of 2017” flag hung on the wall above her desk.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I got the shivers every time I saw it. The thought of college seemed far away but felt closer with Gi’s departure on the horizon. Admission to college was one of the only things my parents really cared about and it lingered as an omnipresent force in our house. Their constant talk of the future seeped deep into my everyday thoughts like some crude invasion of privacy. Even so, I had become attached to the idea of leaving and felt too mature for the trivialities of high school, convinced that college would reap something fresher, better.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">For years, my dream college had been Brown because my dad’s friend was a professor there. I didn’t know much about it, except for that and its prestige.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">On the day after Gi had swept acceptances on the Ivies, my mother had casually mentioned that she thought that I’d like NYU. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was affronted. “Why? I want to go to Brown.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I just think you’d be a better fit there,” she had said. I didn’t quite understand what she was getting at. “Plus, it’s easier to get into.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">There it was. My own mother thought I was too stupid to get into Brown. My grades were high, and I participated in clubs at school, but my efforts seemed miniscule compared to what Gi did. Everything felt like that. I wanted to tell her that she was wrong, that I was just as smart as Gi and that I could also get into whatever school I wanted, do anything I wanted, but I knew in some sick way, she was right.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I often wondered if my opinion of Gi wasn’t about what she did, but about what my parents made of it. I felt as if she had been primed for success and me, failure, from the start. My parents had put us in all of the same activities, just to make their drop-off easier, so it was inevitable that Gi and I had all the same interests. But everything that I could do, she did better.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we were kids, our art teacher refused to let us do the same pictures knowing that it would cause unnecessary tension, but because Gi was older, she got first dibs on all of the good references and I was left with the picked over leftovers. One time, we had gotten into a fight because she had found a spiteful unhappy face hidden in the hills of her Sisley pastel.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">“Aimee ruined my drawing!” she had screamed </span><span class="c2">to my</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;parents. “She drew on it with a pen and I can’t get it off.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No, I didn’t,” I yelled back. I was lying through my teeth, but I was far too proud and bitter to admit it when I was this far in. “Gi is lying. I’d never do that.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Girls,” my dad had said with a warning tone. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“This took me three months to do,” Gi had wailed. It was true, she was slow to finish her pieces. “And now it’s ruined ‘cause of her.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I didn’t do it,” I seethed. “I didn’t.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“The unhappy face didn’t show up out of nowhere,” my mom had said, eyeing me. I looked away. “I’m sure Gi would be forgiving if someone owned up to her actions.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shook my head fiercely. “Why don’t you believe me? I would never do that. Gi probably did it herself because she wants to get me in trouble.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re crazy.” Gi’s fists were clenched white. “We all know you did it.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re lying.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No, you are!”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;“It didn’t show up out of nowhere,” my mom had restated. “Someone had to have drawn that.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sulked and looked out the window, trying not to cry. “Fine, if you want to blame me for it, go ahead. But I didn’t do it.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I had my computer privileges taken away for a week. Gi seemed quite satisfied with herself, transforming the black markings into some birds flying in the distance. My parents hailed her as the new van Gogh. They also hung it up </span><span class="c2">on the</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;fridge. It stared at me every time we ate dinner for the next two months.</span></p>
            <p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was about to barricade myself in my room, still feeling dizzy and a bit nauseous from smoking earlier, when Gi peeked out from the doorframe. “Where were you?” Her long black hair spilled over her shoulders. “I woke up and you were gone.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">“I was </span><span class="c2">at Dolores</span><span class="c1">.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh,” she blinked. “Well, mom and dad should be home soon with dinner. I have some work I need to get done so don’t be too loud.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Did you dye your hair again?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I unconsciously twirled a strand. “A couple weeks ago.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Interesting.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was conversations like these that reminded me why Gi and I had never been close. I didn’t think I hated her, we just never had time for each other. Gi was always so busy with her model student duties that she spent more time away from home than with her family. My parents were prouder than anything, but it left me with an empty feeling every time I heard her name. I tried to convince myself that I wasn’t bothered enough to dwell on it. After all, she did her thing. I did mine.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I was both dreading and looking forward to her leaving. For all that Gi was extraordinary, she was equally parts coddled and sensitive to the point where even my parents would tread lightly. Don’t talk about this, Gi won’t like that. But without Gi around, my parents would laser focus all of their attention on me. I resented that thought more than anything.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We ended up having takeout from some overpriced Thai place downtown. My mom expected us to all sit down for the meal, to eat like a family. I usually was able to avoid this during the school year by cooking my own meals early and eating them in the quietness and seclusion of my room, but it was summer and I was too lazy to </span><span class="c2">expend</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;myself just to avoid some conversation I’d have to have eventually.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“How were your days?” my mom asked. She asked it like she was expecting something new.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Mine was good. I hung out with some friends and did some research in my spare time,” Gi said, in between bites. I rolled my eyes. She was every Asian parent’s dream and it made me sick. Why didn’t she just cure war and famine while she was at it?</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Aimee? How about you?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It was fine,” I said plainly. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What did you do?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I hung out with friends.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That’s nice.” My mom twirled a forkful of pad see ew. “By the way, I’ve signed you up for an SAT bootcamp later this month. You need to boost your score by at least a hundred points.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked down at my plate. “Okay.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“And I’ve scheduled a weekly appointment for a private tutor as well. It’ll be on Wednesdays from three to four.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Okay.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Talk of this made me feel sick and I lost my appetite, not that I had one in the first place. I moved the food on the plate, spreading it in a thin layer. Their voices seemed to fade. I asked to be excused.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the bathroom, I turned on the shower and stripped myself naked. As I waited for the water to heat, I stared at myself in the mirror. I despised the way I looked. My eyes were too small, too dark and my hair was fried orange. I was nothing like the perfect daughter that they wanted me to be. I ran my fingers down the slopes of my ribs and took a deep breath in. My reflection mimicked me, kneeling to the ground.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Days like these were chronic and they soured my mood. I found it funny how my parents were so obsessed with gaining points on some arbitrary test that measured some arbitrary skill but failed to notice that I was dropping one or two pounds a week. All conversations devolved into some discussion of my grades, what classes I’d take next year, what tutors I might need.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The thing was, they weren’t tiger parents. No violin, no Saturday Chinese class. I had always thought that my upbringing was somewhat of a universal Asian American experience. It turned out that was far from the truth. As I grew up, I realized those little things that set us apart, like when my parents constantly refused to buy anything that was labelled “Made in China”. It’s not safe, they would say. China’s a dangerous place. Not only was I disconnected, but my parents were so far removed from our ethnic homeland that they started to perceive it as the other. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">It was strange to think that my grandparents had lived in a small rural village not so long ago. Even so, I had become so far assimilated that I felt some sort of obligatory loyalty to America, even though it didn’t seem to want me either. I was an outlier in both forms, a Chinese and an American. </span><span class="c3">My parents were only Chinese until they weren’t and by that, I mean, not at all.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">My mom was born and raised in the city and my dad, in Oakland. They both attended UC Berkeley and had met each other at a mutual friend’s picnic. Only my mother could speak Chinese; a broken Americanized mother tongue, only reserved for conversations with my po po that always seemed to end in a frustrated sigh. Chinese always sounded more passionate, fiercer than the placid, bitter lilt of my own American voice. Gi had been through several Mandarin classes, from elementary to high school. I didn’t know why she embraced it and why I didn’t. Couldn’t. I only knew sparse, useless phrases. Enough to order dim sum for my non-Chinese friends, but not enough for the cashier at the 99 Ranch who promptly seals her lips when she realizes I’m nothing like her.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">It was the middle of summer when I noticed that Clover was getting worse. She was going out more with her other friends, whoever they were, and started to brag about things like popping molly or doing </span><span class="c6">blow</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in the bathroom of clubs. I was disgusted. Who was even letting a sixteen-year-old in? I found the obsessive partying a bit obnoxious, but I kept quiet, wondering if she would invite me soon. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Do you think she’ll be okay?” Irma asked me after Clover had greened out for the second time this summer. She had eaten three edibles from her dealer, almost double the amount of her limit, and we had to restrain her from jumping into the ocean because she thought it wasn’t real.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Yeah,” I told her, as if I knew. “I think she’ll be fine.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was wrong, of course. The day after we had that conversation, Clover texted us from a new number saying she had run away and to meet her at Kezar Stadium. She had brought a backpack only filled with a heavy jacket, a notebook, and a container of weed. Clover told us she was dead serious about running away and that she needed to change her appearance. So we bought chestnut hair dye and, in the filth of the bathroom, cut and dyed her hair.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was a messy and awful job on our ends. Her curled blonde ringlets were gone, replaced with frizzed mousy brown hair. I almost didn’t recognize her. And I guess she didn’t either because once it dried, she crumbled to the ground and wept. I couldn’t say anything that would make her feel better, nor did Irma, so we just held her in our arms, our warm bodies as one.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">She went home the next day, but my mom was appalled to hear about the incident. I left out most of the details and had only told her in hopes of gaining her trust, but it seemed to backfire.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">“You </span><span class="c6">dyed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;what?” She let out a short breath. “I don’t want you hanging out with her anymore. And while you’re at it, stop frying your hair. It looks dead.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I ignored the hair comment. “You can’t be serious.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I’m sorry, Aimee, but I don’t feel comfortable with you being friends with someone like that. Clover is no longer welcome in this house.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I stared at her. “You can’t stop me from hanging out with people. She’s my friend.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Don’t test me on this. I am your mother and you will listen to what I say.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I wanted to scream, say something, do something that racy and rash Clover might do. But I couldn’t because I knew that deep down, she was right. It was nauseating to think about. I wondered if someone else’s parents would look at me the same way. Would they stare at me and pull their kid a little closer? Would my old straight-laced friends wonder what went wrong? Would a younger me be satisfied with the person I was, the person I had become? These thoughts made me feel hollow, like a shell of somebody that I once was. I tried not to linger on it.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It didn’t take me long to figure out that I was able to avoid this rule relatively easily by just going out more. My parents worked like dogs and would frequently stay at their sterile offices downtown late into the night, unable to enforce anything when they weren’t physically there. Plus, it wasn’t like I hadn’t been able to get around them before.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">On the hottest day of summer in July, my friends had a bonfire at the fire pits in Ocean Beach with stolen vodka from the Safeway nearby and cheap weed from hippie bums on Haight. Clover invited a couple of kids from St. Ignatius, the prep school down a couple blocks from our high school. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">My mother’s words seemed to echo in my brain. I was starting to enjoy the scene less; it felt like a routine. Drink, gossip, drink some more. That was all Clover and Irma seemed to want to do.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Somehow, a red cup still ended up in my hand. I was already on my third of the night, some mix of vodka and Red Bull, when I heard a familiar voice call my name. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Aimee, is that you?” It was Siena, an old middle school acquaintance, sitting on a pink beach towel, sipping out of a Watermelon Four Loko. We hadn’t really talked since graduating, but we had mutual friends, like Irma, who periodically mentioned her name to me.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“It’s so good to see you,” I said, giving her a limp hug. I sat on the opposite side of the fire. “How have you been?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Eh,” she shrugged. “Been better.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Truthfully, I had never enjoyed Siena’s company. I found her a bit vain and cliquey, but we had a lot of interests that intersected so seeing her was sometimes unavoidable. The thing that irked me the most about her was her monopoly on Asianness, a topic that always seemed to wedge itself into our conversations. She was a quarter Japanese, but blonde and white passing. I hated talking about the subject, much less with someone like her.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“It’s just so hard,” she said, flicking the cap of the can. “People expect me to be dumb ‘cause I look white.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“You are white,” I told her. “Plus, isn’t that better than people expecting that you’re smart?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">“No,” Siena sighed. “You wouldn’t get it. It would be easier to be </span><span class="c6">full</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Asian.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was a strange thing to say to me. I took offense. “What do you know about being Asian?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“More than you,” she said. The fire crackled. “Ames, I hate to break it to you, but you’re not Asian. You’re so white-washed that you’re practically whiter than me.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I wanted to slam my head in. “You’re joking, right?” I let out a short laugh.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">“I’m serious. I speak Japanese. I </span><span class="c6">have family</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in Japan. I’m connected. And what? You’re taking French?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I didn’t have an answer to that. She stared at me and I stared right back. It wasn’t that she was right, but I couldn’t argue. I thought I had picked up French absentmindedly. A couple of my friends were taking it, so why couldn't I? After all, I had convinced myself that I was just like them. But maybe I wasn’t, and the truth was that I hated the thought of taking Chinese, hated it with every bone in my body. I wanted to be something different than what I was expected to be, and French was lyrical and acceptable and better in comparison to the harsh and spit-covered sentences from my po po’s mouth. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was suddenly disgusted with myself, more than ever before. I was so desperate to be Chinese, to be white, to be anything other than what I was, who I was, but instead I was nothing. And everyone knew it.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I couldn’t speak to Siena for the rest of the night, avoiding her and her stupid labels. On top of that, Irma and Clover had disappeared, probably to smoke their brains out in the Beach Chalet bathroom. So I drank alone, pounding solo cup after solo cup until I collapsed onto the cold sand, the night sky staring down at me with its beady, white eyes.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">I don’t remember much of that night, except that I got home relatively early in the morning. Gi was in the kitchen, the newest edition of </span><span class="c6 c13">The Economist</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;clutched in her right hand, a cup of coffee in her left. The door closed behind me and she looked up. Her eyes were blank. I didn’t say anything. Neither did she.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I reached for the banana on the counter, realizing that I hadn’t eaten anything since yesterday morning. I was at the point where I couldn’t even pretend to eat. Food was simply for preventing my body from shutting down. Gi shook her head at me and scoffed.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“What?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Don’t you have anything to say?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I gave her a look. “About what?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Mom was awake all night wondering where you were,” Gi said. “They were worried sick.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Right.” I thought I had texted them letting them know I was sleeping over at Irma’s. Apparently not. I brushed a hand through my hair, getting stuck an inch from the bottom. I hated how plastic the strands felt, like it wasn’t my own. “Well, I’m here now.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“She cried, you know,” Gi said woodenly. “They both did.” A pause. “They’re concerned about you, Aimee. I am too.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Oh, fuck off.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“Fine. Just know that you’re doing a grand job of fucking up your life.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I narrowed my eyes, trying to astral project myself into her shoes. How good it would feel to be a poster child of success, bathe in our parent’s affection, kiss ass to all of our good-as-dead ancestors? But all I saw were cruel omens. Heaps of them, bloated.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">“I’m sorry I can’t be perfect like you.” </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c3">She bit the inside of her cheek as if stopping herself from saying anything she might regret. The sick thing was, I wanted her to say it. I wanted her to cry and scream at me for being like this, for failing myself in the most perverted way possible. Because then, I knew that she would have at least cared. But we didn’t really talk about that kind of thing. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c6">The toaster dinged and Gi forked a burnt bagel out. She chewed on it, mouth-open, carnal Doberman-style. I was no longer hungry, quite the opposite, so I walked to the bathroom, locked the door, and ran the sink on high. Then, </span><span class="c6">stuck</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;two fingers down my throat.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was already August. I didn’t know if it was the weather, but I suddenly felt restless, as if phantom hands were poised around my neck, ready to cobra squeeze. Junior year of high school was the most important for college and the thought of that slowly ate away at my resolve. My parents were still hawks about my SAT score. I was supposed to take the test by the end of the month.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gi would be gone by then. I felt more distant from her than ever, couldn’t even bear to look at her when it was just the two of us. Like we weren’t even sisters anymore, just strangers. I didn’t know what she wanted me to do. But I guess I didn’t even know what I wanted either.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On the night before she was supposed to fly to Boston, she knocked on my bedroom door.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hey.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I looked at her. “Hi.” A pause. “Did you need something?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No, I—” she shrugged. Her eyes were pink and puffy. “I just thought. Well y’know.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I squinted, confused. “What?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I wanted to say goodbye. ‘Cause I’m going to be…” she trailed off. “Boston is just really far away.” I nodded slowly and scooched over on my bed. She sat down next to me. Her body radiated warmth. “I know it hasn’t always been good between us, Aimee. But I want you to be able to talk to me.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Heat spread to my cheeks. I didn’t know what to say to that.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“High school is hard. Being a kid is hard. I mean, for fuck’s sake, I’m still one,” Gi exhaled. “I know it looks like I have my life together, but really, I have no idea. And you don’t have to go through this—” she waved her hand around. “All by yourself. You’re not alone.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I know,” I said. “I know that.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was silent for a bit. “I’m scared,” she said. “I don’t think I’m ready.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re going to love it. I just know you will,” I told her, ignoring the lump in my throat. I didn’t know why but my hands were sweating. “You’ve been working for this your entire life. It’s your dream.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yeah,” Gi picked at her palm as if she was pulling out needles one-by-one. “I guess it is.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m really proud of you,” I swallowed. “Like, really.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She stared, unblinkingly. “That means a lot, Aimee. Thank you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I mean, my sister’s going to Harvard. How could I not?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Gi smiled at me, her eyes crinkling into forked slits. “Right, well—” She kneaded her thigh. “Look, Aimee. I’m not the best with words, but I’ve been meaning to tell you that I’m sorry. For all that thing that I had said before. I don’t know why I said it. It’s not true and I don’t want you thinking that I meant it. What I wanted to say, well… I just know that you are going to do great things.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What she said left a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach for the rest of the week. Never in my life had I ever talked like that with Gi. It seemed cruel. That I was left like this right before she was to leave. There were so many things I wanted to ask her. How she felt about our parents, her friends, her Asianness. How she felt about me. I could never talk about any of these things with anyone else, I knew at least that much. I didn’t love her, but I wanted to. Or maybe I did love her, and I just wanted to be loved back.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She left before I woke up. The house was quiet without Gi around, more so than I expected it to be. To fill space, I spent more time away from home, usually at Clover’s. We would do our homework, laze around listening to 70s music, and even roll a joint occasionally. Do all of the things teen girls could.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">That was why I was caught off guard when I woke up to five missed calls from Irma at three in the morning. I called her back, a feeling of dread eating away with every ring. What had happened? Was she okay? Would I be in trouble? She picked up on the fifth.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Clover’s parents sent her to rehab,” she said. “She’s gone.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re joking.” Irma made a tsk sound. “No—you’re serious?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It was like an intervention or something. They just took her. And now she’s gone, just like that. Poof.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It seemed like something out of a movie. “How do you know?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“She texted me right before they took her phone.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh, wow.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yeah.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What does that mean for us?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I don’t know.” She paused. “Nothing’s gonna change, at least I don’t think so.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Right.”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I sat on the news for a while. It felt like she’d be gone forever, or at the very least, a long time. It was horrible to admit, but I was somewhat relieved. I was tired of getting high or drunk every weekend, tired of being the cause of my mother’s graying hair, tired of pretending to be someone I wanted to be.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We met up the next day after school, to hash things over and figure out what had happened, what had gone wrong. At first, it was weird hanging out with Irma alone. I hadn’t realized how different we were without the hazy smoke in our lungs. We were always too busy babysitting Clover and talking about other people to really get to know each other. But once we did, I found that I was brutally mistaken.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I think it’s because I had this misconstrued idea of what it meant to be Asian. Maybe I was the hypocrite, delineating who could and couldn’t be Asian based on stereotypes that I condemned. We somehow slid into a talk about it. She would never be seen as a real Korean, Irma explained, even though she frequently visited Korea for her grandparents and spoke fluent Korean.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">“At least, sort-of-fluent,” she said. “I’m trying. And I think that’s all you can ask for, right?”</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our conversation was filled with stories from our childhood: how people used to pull their eyes at us, how our crushes always seemed to pick the pretty blonde girls, how we were constantly torn between the battle of assimilation and keeping our heritage alive in our own little way. I guess it was a shameful topic that we both wanted to forget, to make it disappear. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">We were still different people though. She still kept with the partiers and I couldn’t bring myself to go back to that scene. </span><span class="c1">I think it was because part of me suddenly wanted to be good, whatever that meant. Later that week, I called Gi for the first time, searching for some answers. I wanted her to tell me that I wasn’t a mess, that I could be the daughter that my parents adored. I wanted her to validate my existence. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t have to—I already knew.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">On some uneventful weekend afternoon, I cut my hair off and dyed it black. The dye stained my ears and the nape of my neck. My hair hung just above my shoulders and it felt light, almost weightless. It was the first time in four years that I looked the way I had been born.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While my hair was drying, I threw on some clothes and took the 29 and L train to the nearest park, a small playground on Taraval next to the local library. It had rained the day before, but it was warm and the sun was out. The breeze was light, so I laid down on the wet grass and caught a glimpse of my reflection in a window.</span></p>
