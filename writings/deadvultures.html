            <h3 id="main">dismal; dead vultures</h3>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I spotted a plastic bag from Party City on the wet sidewalk, filled with air. There was a joke or saying about it, but I couldn’t remember. I didn’t remember a lot of things, but that was probably for the better. A gust of wind sliced through my teeth and the bag whistled with it, transforming into a black vulture singed from the white plastic. Then, it flew away.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were three corner stores in a row with the same products on display like a tessellation. The one next to me had neon lights spelling out “Open 24/7, 7 days a week”. When I walked into it, I noticed it was much brighter inside than out, or so I thought because when I looked out the window, the sky was red. I could’ve lost myself in the red. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The chime of the register echoed and I stared at the candy beside the register. Everything seemed to be glowing. The lettering on the M&amp;Ms. Almond Joy’s fleshy coconuts. The Twix especially. They looked like tiny gold bars. I reached out to touch one, but I couldn’t feel anything. Kind of like when you drink too much whiskey, that fourth or fifth shot, numb liquid down the hatchet.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The way to tell if you were in a dream was to notice that you were watching yourself in third person. I saw myself disintegrate, temporality on steroids. There was a blaring, sharpening noise and then uneventfully, I woke up.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sound warbled once, then twice. I palmed over my bed to find my Blackberry Bold and when I located it, pressed the cold screen against my ear. The call was from my younger sister, Paloma, and her voice flooded in with a rushed disposition. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“I lost my job,” she said, as soon as our lines connected. “The company’s gone under.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was eight in the morning. Nine there in New York. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Everyone did. There’s nobody left at Decker—you should have seen it. The office was entirely empty.” </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I rubbed my eyes. “What are you even going on about? You quit work?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“No, Janie, you don’t understand. I didn’t quit.” Her voice, sweet and subtle. A waver. “There was nothing to quit. Everything’s gone.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn’t believe her for some reason. Maybe it was the coyness of her voice, or the static through the phone. I tucked the phone into my ear with the point of my shoulder and slathered two pumps of CeraVe on my hands. They got dry in the winter. “Just Decker?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“No, no,” she rushed. “Everything’s crashed. Everything and more. It’s all coming down. The whole market’s gone berserk.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“What do you mean? The whole system?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“All those bankers on Wall Street. Everyone was in bed with them, Decker included. So now, everything’s gone.” Paloma let out a breath. “All of the corporations. They’ve gone bankrupt.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, my palms were sweaty. I didn’t know much about Wall Street, other than it appearing in the news from time to time when I had the chance to read it. Dow Jones up 400 points. Nasdaq down half a percent. I didn’t even keep my money in any of it—too risky. Too much speculation on things I didn’t understand. I tended to keep out of those things for more reasons than I knew, but the thought of it being gone made me ill for some reason. Bankrupt. It was such a loaded word. I swallowed thickly. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Pal, the system. What do you mean about the whole system?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“It’s gone,” she said. “Turned into a black hole.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma never answered my question, hanging up shortly after. She had things to do, things to worry of her own to worry about. I wasn’t sure what she was talking about. So, I searched the internet, looking at a Variety listicle of bankrupt companies. I gnawed on my half-eaten Slim Jim from the night before and when that was gone, gnawed on the ends of my hair. It went on forever—the number wasn't in the hundreds, but the thousands. Variety was one of them.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I felt angry all of a sudden. A few cities, a few people, determined the pot for the rest of us in Michigan City. I wanted to go out into the streets and yell our names, yell until we were heard. Tell them that we were here too. That I was here. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">No more cerulean slushies from 7-Eleven. No more cargo pants from Tommy Hilfiger, especially not the ones with three pockets down the left leg that I loved. I didn’t know if I could function without these things. Life was looking more and more barren by the second. The thought of it made me anxious and I ran to my toilet and threw up my dinner from the night before.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn’t talk to anyone for days, not that I had anyone in particular to talk to. I shut down my phone and hid it under my mattress. I closed the blinds and turned off the lights. I even turned off the heating. I considered reverting to an ascetic lifestyle, moving to China and living in the mountains. Or maybe somewhere closer, like the Appalachians. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I drank the reserves from the cellar, my parent’s prized wine. I stared at my blank walls and then, my blank canvas. Art felt pointless. If there weren’t these big companies making things, paying people, or whatever they did, there wouldn’t be anything left for a small-town artist trying to make a living. I would be homeless in six months, unable to pay off the property taxes. Dead in a year. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The thought made my head pulsate, so I held my breath and slowed my heart rate. I tended to extrapolate.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was worrying to me. I was supposed to hate these institutions, but at the same time, I didn’t know how to function without them. I was taking six milligrams of melatonin, triple my usual dose, to even close my eyes and my supply was running dry. My head felt detached from my body and it made my gums ache.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">At night, my room would be pitch black and I would try to imagine myself flying over the sharp blades of sunlight, over the claustrophobic atmosphere. It was always a Hubba Bubba pink. I would rise above it all and when I reached the top, I promised myself that I could sleep. But I never did. It seemed like no one could. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn’t know if our collective insomnia was because of the same worries. I hardly doubt it was. But in some way, it was comforting knowing that there were people out there, sleepless. So I stayed awake, shifting in my bed under the pretense that I would have a dream again.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma knocked on my front door, approximately a week after she had last called me.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Sorry,” she said. “I meant to call first. But you never responded to your texts. So I figured you wouldn’t have picked up anyways.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Behind her was a pair of suitcases. “You’re… staying here?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“I had to get out of there,” she said. “The city. It got to be too much, y’know?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I nodded, not knowing what she meant. Her Vivienne Westwood necklace hung on her clavicle as she leaned forward to pick up her bags. “Is it okay if I take my old room?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“I converted it into my studio a while back.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">She blinked. “Oh.” Paloma paused and took a look around. “You’ve changed up the place.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I still couldn’t believe that my sister was at my front door. I had taken over our childhood place after our parents had passed, partly because I had been staying with my ex-boyfriend at the time, and partly because I didn’t have the heart to sell it. There were too many memories held in the walls and floorboards of the place. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma was long gone when that happened. She had always been the better one out of the two of us. Better university, better job. She had been doing some IT work at Decker before the crash. It felt funny to think about—that there was a new before and after. It used to be before 9/11, after 9/11. Before Britney Spears’s meltdown, after Britney Spears’s meltdown.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">She walked right in and started to rummage through the fridge. “Shit, Janie. You have nothing in here.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I trailed after her like a ghost. “Dunno.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“What do you even eat?” Paloma stared at me with wild eyes. “Have you been eating?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I pointed to a half-open box of Ritz crackers. I hadn’t found the energy to go to the supermarket, though I found that I wasn’t hungry for anything in particular.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“God, you’re a mess,” Paloma tsked, closing the fridge door. Her hand was still latched on to the handle, thin dainty fingers with a fresh French manicure. When did she have time to get them done? I looked down at my own hands, embarrassed. My nails were stained with linseed oil. “Anyways. Since my room’s all taken up, can I sleep in your bed?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“With me?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Yeah,” she said. Her hand flexed and then slipped into her pocket. “I’m not going to kick you out of your room. But the couch is well… you know.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Course you can,” I said, after a beat. “This was your home too, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">She smiled, a bit tenderly. “I know. But it's yours now.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn’t know what to make out of that. It felt weird to call it mine when it was something we shared. It almost felt wrong to agree with her, but I found myself nodding. Blinking along, like a broken stoplight.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I finally got the courage to see the town the next day, after some coercing from Paloma. She insisted that we needed to get some fresh food, but I think she just wanted to see how the town was doing. I didn’t know why I was so afraid. I couldn’t attribute this sinking feeling to anything, but the sinking feeling itself.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">We went to Meijer, but it was closed. We then tried Aldi, but that was closed too. Something clicked after seeing Aldi’s closed—I had been going there for the discounted fruits every Sunday night. It was a devastating sight to see.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I started to hiccup and then couldn’t stop. Paloma had to take the wheel. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">She drove the car foreignly as if she hadn’t gotten her license in it, all those years back. We drove around town aimlessly looking for a place, looking for any signs of life, until we realized that most of it was closed. It made sense. All of the places we would usually go to had to suspend operations. Even the 24-hour Subway had no lights on.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma and I ended up on the main strip of the town, going to a local grocery store that we had frequented with our parents when we were kids. I never got the urge to go into a place like this when there were big supermarket alternatives that had everything I needed and more. But now that I was here, I felt guilty for neglecting the localities. After all, the supermarket corporations didn’t have a family to feed. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">When we opened the door, a bell chimed.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Welcome in!” the owner’s voice called out. He was a burly man with white eyebrows and even whiter hair. I didn’t recognize his face. “I apologize for the lack of selection. Our supply chains are running a bit short from the crash.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“That’s fine,” Paloma assured him. “We aren’t picky.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">We went up and down the aisles, plucking off various treats from the shelves like we’d never shopped before. Three bags of Haribo Happy Cola gummies. Two blocks of Bellavitano cheese. A bag of kale, slightly yellowing at the tips. None of it went together. Was any of it supposed to? All of the pantry staples were gone, no rice, beans, or pasta in sight. People seemed to have stockpiled as if we had dawned on the apocalypse. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">We went to pay and I reached for my card hesitantly. I barely had a thousand dollars in savings and a quarter of it would drain to the utilities due next week. Three weeks before, I had sold a painting to a Danish millionaire who had been generous enough to fund the materials. I briefly wondered how he was doing, if he was still wealthy. If my painting meant anything to him anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma must have sensed something, or I could have just been taking too long, so she whipped out her shiny Visa and handed it to the man.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“I got it covered, Janie,” she told me. “I have a good reserve we can dip into for now. My bank was overtaken by the FDIC.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“FDIC? What’s that?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Doesn’t matter. All that matters is that my money didn’t go bust. Well, excluding deflation.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Didn’t the banks go bankrupt?” I asked, confused.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“They did. But it still works,” she said. The card was accepted and we took our groceries, waved goodbye to the man, and walked back to our car. “Cause it’s operating through the state.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Good thing I have no money anyways,” I said. The sun had come out from the clouds. It was three in the afternoon because we had slept in until one. The streets were empty.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“How have you been surviving, Janie?” she asked. “I had a hard time at first, y’know. But it’s better now, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I blinked. “What do you mean? People are unemployed, Pal.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“No, they’re liberated.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I didn’t know why she had a sudden change of heart, at least from the dreary conversation we had over the phone. Something about this disgusted me and I swallowed the pooling spit in my mouth. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Liberated?” I stopped walking. “Thousands of people will probably die. They don’t have a source of income anymore. They don’t have a livelihood. There’s no direction in which our country is heading. The entire world, for that matter.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Do you think people dream of work? People want to go to a boring office job and type boring, meaningless shit on their computers to make rich people richer? I thought you would know.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I gave her a look. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“You’re an artist, Janie. You’ve never subscribed to—” she waved her hands around. “You know. All of this. And now that everyone has a chance to be like you, to be free like you… I don’t know. It just seems hypocritical.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I wanted to say something back, but I felt like I couldn’t. From an outside view, maybe I was someone to be envied. I had always looked up to people like Paloma, people that could function in a high-rewarding society. I had never thought that people would look at the way I used my time and wish they were me. My life felt unstable. Regressive. Now more than ever. Now more than I would ever care to admit.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma started a vegetable garden in our backyard. Apparently, it was called a victory garden. That was smart of her because a few days after we had gone to the old grocery store, it closed, just like the other ones. I thought we’d starve but Paloma found a farmer’s market that came into town in Gary, so we made the drive over and picked up an arm full of cucumbers, peaches, and snap peas.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The farmers we talked to didn’t seem worried at all. Maybe they were pleased to be free from their corporate obligations. “The yield expectations would always be unrealistic,” one woman said. “They’d always want more. More than our fields could handle.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">We were eating garbage, they had said. Swelled fruits and veggies that no longer held the nutritional content that the advertisements proclaimed. Paloma nodded along intently, as if she’d known this all along. That bothered me. She had been just like them, pumping along Excel sheets, fake programs, whatever. She wasn’t any different. I couldn’t help but feel this tightening sensation in my chest.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma planted tomatoes in the boxes and kale under the birch tree. She had found the seeds in the towel closet, of all things. “Seeds never die,” she said. “They just go dormant. I wonder what life would have been like if we could go dormant. Would we be better people?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Hm. I don’t know,” I said, leaning against the banister. I had a cup of year-old Folgers in my hand. “Do you think we would?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma was patting in the dirt. She gave a spray of water to the seeds. “I think… humanity would care more about each other. Or maybe the opposite.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Well think about it,” she reasoned. “People now are selfish, but not selfish enough to destroy their relationships since there’s repercussions. People have to be good to others or else, they wouldn’t get any good back to ‘em.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“So you either think we’re inherently good or bad.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“More the latter,” she said. “I mean, how did it get so bad in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">It took me a while to realize what she meant. The whole situation. How did corporations get so big? The government was useless, but maybe because we called it useless, stupid, and had no faith in it, then there were no expectations for it to be anything for us. It could be different from what it was made to be, made to do.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I couldn’t answer her question, though I didn’t think she expected me to. I wasn’t tuned into anything. Paloma was the one always on the Internet. She found a way to read the newspaper since the paper had stopped coming to our doorstep. I didn’t know if it was because my debit card could no longer pay for the subscription or if it was because the whole company went under. I found that I didn’t really care anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I started having dreams again that night. The vultures were back, but they were dead. I tried to revive them, though I didn’t know why. I would press their thick, bloody beaks to my lips and inhale. Taste their last kill on my tongue. Breathe them life, breathe a partition of my life into theirs. Nothing I did actually changed anything.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I don’t know why I was trying so hard for those dead vultures. Maybe it was because they looked so pitiful dead. Maybe it was because I half-expected other vultures to swoop in and eat them. Their breasts, thighs, innards, until they were just bones. But when I looked up, all I saw was a clear sky.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“The government made an announcement last night,” Paloma said. We were at breakfast, eating the remainder of the goat cheese and bread we got from the neighbor. We had traded her the first couple of pears from a fifteen-year-old tree that our father had planted when we were kids. “The banks are going to be regulated.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I didn’t know what to say. Was I supposed to pop open champagne and celebrate? Wasn’t it the fault of the government that we were in this position now? I looked at Paloma, her murky eyes staring back at me.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“You know,” she said, as if reading my mind. “I think it’s gonna be different this time, Janie.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I sighed. “It wasn’t like my life was bad before, y’know.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Of course not. But it wasn’t the best either. You were living paycheck to paycheck. Painting to painting.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“But I was living.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">Paloma shook her head. “I see the issue. Janie, of course it’s okay to feel like you had it good before the crash. Because you were able to eat whatever you wanted, wear whatever you wanted, all that stuff. And now it feels desolate right? Because a lot of the stuff is closed.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I nodded slowly. “Yeah, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“But here’s the catch. Nothing is actually gone.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“Well, just think,” she said, pausing to take a bite out of her toast. “Everything you wanted, you still have. And everything you want, you can get. And even if you wanted it, do you need it?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">I blinked at her. In some ways, she was right. Those things I craved, the things I thought I couldn’t live without, they weren’t anything to begin with. Marlboro Reds. Dusted Twinkies, with a side of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. I didn’t need these things and yet, I still yearned for them, the way a widower would.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">“That’s the point of capitalism,” Paloma said. “You’re never satisfied.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was some pain in admitting what I already knew. “I guess I didn’t know how to feel anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1">The rest of breakfast was silent. Not in a deafening sense, but with an air of some peaceful equilibrium. We had this chance to start over, all of us, together as one. I knew things had to get bad before things got better, that’s just how the world worked. I didn’t know how everything would unfold, but I knew that it was going to be something different than what we had before. Something more hopeful, more humane.</span></p>
