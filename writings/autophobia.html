<div><p class="c7"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p></div>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Want to join the cause?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She’s young, maybe sixteen or seventeen in age. Her eyes are earnest and bright and hopeful as she waits for my answer. Dressed in modest clothes and wearing a button that switches between bolded messages like “They’re not just bodies” and “Everyone has a right to life”, she looks exactly how I would expect a pro-lifer to look like. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I smile at her kindly. “Maybe another day. Sorry, I’m in a rush.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I try to walk away, but to my surprise, she steps in front of me. “Ma’am, we don’t have another day,” she insists. Her hologram of petitions circles around her, bouncing with movement as she draws in closer to me. A single piece of paper extends outwards to me, a pen manifesting alongside of it. “We have to act now. People are dying. People are being sacrificed at the hands of the law. This practice </span><span class="c0 c3">must</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;be stopped.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I’m sorry,” I repeat, trying to be as curt as possible while taking a step backward. The fewer words exchanged, the better. “I don’t have anything for you.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She looks at me a little strangely, eyebrows furrowed in something between discontent and disbelief. And then it’s like slow motion. I can only watch as a bulb goes off in her head and see the gears in her mind turn and click as she realizes who I am. What I am. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“You’re one of them,” she says quietly. Our eyes lock, but I avert mine immediately. “Aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don’t answer her and wait for her to step aside to let me pass, which she does after a few seconds. I continue walking and feel her watching me from behind. Her eyes burn into my </span><span class="c0">back</span><span class="c1 c0">, the heat crawling up my neck. Something comes over me and I glance over my shoulder. She’s still staring with that masked expression. They all are. So I look at her with an upturned glance and ask her this: “Isn’t everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Back in the day, people lived till sixty. Sometimes seventy.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Callie gets like this on Tuesdays. Like clockwork, a new subject every week until she runs out and needs to repeat. I humor her each time, but not without discomfort. I just don’t like talking about things that aren’t supposed to be talked about. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">“That’s very old,” I reply. It’s been a few days since the incident, but the protester’s dark gaze stains my memory. She had given me </span><span class="c0 c3">that</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;stare, the one that makes my insides churn. Something I wish I could rip apart of my conscience, the guilt of it all, but I don’t have the heart to do it. “Some people still do. Live until that age.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Her back is to me and she’s clad in a silk robe, on the tips of her bare toes. “Yeah, but not by choice.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Right.” A sip of coffee. Callie’s devious or dumb, or both. Being younger in theory never fails to make her act younger. Then again, maybe I’m giving her too much credit. Maybe she doesn’t even know what she’s saying. Her brain’s been chopped up and fried to a crisp. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">It’s morning and the skies have just turned blue. The daily news briefing materializes in front of me, on the dot of the hour. I skim the headlines.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Seventy,” Callie repeats. “That’s absolutely fascinating.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Yeah, that’s how aging works, doll. Or… used to work, I suppose.” </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She’s trying to pop a pimple in the mirror, the white of its head angrily bulging. She pauses and takes a glance at me when she notices my staring, hands dropping to her hips. Her youthful form has been getting the best of her recently. “Yeah, but isn’t it, like, crazy?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I guess I can’t really imagine a life where I didn’t have the… well, you know,” I tread carefully. “Option.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Callie snorts. “It’s not a dirty word.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Well,” I say. “Some people still don’t have it.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">“Most,” Callie corrects. “Most people.” She turns and makes eye contact with me through the mirror, fingers pinching her cheeks red. It looks like </span><span class="c0">the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;pimple’s about to burst, and a second later, it does, erupting all over the mirror. She wipes the pus off of her skin, a satisfied grin spreading over her thin lips. “They’re called donors for a reason.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“It feels dehumanizing.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“They’re not humans, Jun,” Callie presses, falling into the seat next to me. She props her head up with her arm. Red hair spills across her thin, angular shoulders. “Or at least not our kind. Plus, you’re one to talk.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I don’t have the strength for it. “Callie. I don’t want to do this.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She shrugs and turns back to the mirror and continues to pick at her face, red blotches emerging like watercolor on wet paper. It’s so easy for her. There’s no denying that I’m jealous of her guilt-free careless attitude.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Heat fills my cheeks and my eyes water without warning. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Callie suddenly turns around and I shelter my face, ashamed. Her eyes are trained on me like I’m her prey, ready to pounce at any moment. “I’m sorry,” she says finally, after a few seconds of silence. “I must have pushed you too far. I know you don’t like talking about it.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“No, it’s okay. It’s not that. It’s just—” I let out a sigh. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Just what?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Nothing,” I shrug. Her eyes are all I can think about, gleaming at me with stoicism. “Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Callie doesn’t seem to think so. She’s instantly wrapping me into a hug, her sweet lavender perfume overloading my senses. It’s something familiar and suddenly tears drip down my cheeks. I don’t know why, but they do, and I don’t want it to seem like a big deal, nor do I think it really is, but my body says otherwise as these tears splatter onto the table. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Oh, Junnie,” she says. “Sweet girl.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I’m hit with this wave of déjà vu. This has happened many times before, myself in Callie’s arms wrapped in the floral scent. I’ve been in her arms, both big and small, but it always feels the same. The feeling always remains the same. I look up at her, feeling tiny, and she looks down at me. I bite the inside of my cheek to stop myself from doing anything I’d regret. I feel her pull away. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“We can talk about it,” she adds on. “If you want.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I’m fine,” I tell her. I dry my eyes with the sleeve of my blouse. “Really.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Callie’s facing me completely. She’s pretty in this form, with her high, sculpted cheekbones and fox-like eyes. Freckles spray across the span of her nose and a little bit into her forehead and cheeks. Her lips are naturally pink and curved downward slightly, a trait she always has no matter what form she’s in. The donor was twenty when Callie had picked her. Only a year has passed since the transfer and it shows. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">On the other hand, I’ve been in this body for a little longer than I’d like to admit. My donor was sixteen when I was transferred and I’ve grown with it, from the resolution of pubescence to the exposition of adulthood. But, like most things that have been sitting around for too long, this form is almost at its expiration point. I can see some wrinkles settling into the fine lines near my eyes when I smile and keep finding grey hairs in the back of my head. Callie has been bugging me to get transferred this entire past year, ever since she went through the procedure. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I forgot how great it feels,” she had said, a couple of days after recovery. “I feel like a hundred.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">And now, I feel old next to Callie with her youthful glow as we sit at the breakfast nook together. My hands are in hers, but they look so dated in comparison and it almost makes me feel guilty for some reason or another. She looks like she could be my daughter, given a couple of years. I curl inside my chair. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The thing is, I am old. Maybe my body isn’t, but my mind surely is. And it’s hard to reconcile that maybe this really isn’t my body, but a temporary vessel. But then again, why should I care so much? As long as I am Juno, does it really matter?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Juno.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“What?” I glance up, perturbed. Her hand is gripped by my own, slender fingers squished into a bouquet, and I hadn’t even realized that I was holding her so tight. I immediately let go. I wipe my palm, a little wet, onto my pants. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Don’t think too much about… it,” she says carefully, rubbing out the white in her hand, where I had left my mark. “You shouldn’t torture yourself like this.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I wasn’t,” I try to say, but it comes out as a croak. Her hand floods with a pinkish hue and shame lodges in my throat. “I really wasn’t.” </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Okay,” Callie blinks. “I just want to make sure that you’re not, well… you know.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I attempt to give her a genuine smile, but I know it’s not and she does too. We both ignore it, both know each other a little too well, both don’t want to talk about it any longer. And so Callie turns on the hologram to play some of our favorite classics from the earlier years, leaving us to reminisce in our own way. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">It’s a week later and I’m sitting in a chair across from the consultant. His office is set in the middle of the ocean, and the waves crash earnestly, beneath, in front of, and next to me. It’s a little jarring and unnatural, a theme that I’d never choose, but personal taste is personal taste for a reason, I suppose. A couple of birds fly overhead from a distance. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Juno Speckerman-21. Correct?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Yes,” I say. “That’s me.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“It says here that this is your… fourth vessel? You’ve used this form for twenty years. Is this correct?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“And you’re here for a fifth vessel consultancy,” he notes, flipping through his hologram. “Looks like you’re due for one. Actually… maybe even a little overdue for this. Is there a reason why you decided to wait?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I just liked this one,” I shrug. “Was comfortable.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Well, you could have always chosen from the same line, but I get what you mean,” he gives me a wink. A typical schmoozing move. “Some of them just have that little… spark.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I just nod. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Well,” he continues. “It looks like since you’re an experienced member, we don’t need to go through too much procedure. I assume that you want to keep everything. As you know, there is a risk when we do the transfer and it is possible, although very unlikely that a malfunction happens. But that’s in the decimals of percentages so I wouldn’t be too worried, especially since it’s been easy and successful with you before. I think that all we have left is to pick out your donor and set a time and date. How does that sound?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Sounds perfect, thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Alright, then let’s look at some potential matches.” He moves a couple of things around on his hologram and pulls up a couple of donors. They’re all vaguely similar to the body I’m in now. Curly black hair. Golden skin. A thin nose. “Some of the ones I’ve selected are based on your past choices.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“That’s very thoughtful,” I say as I click on the first suggested donor and look closer at the features. It’s very pretty, almost too pretty. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Number 90725. Nineteen years of maturity. This one only has minimal health defects, mainly pertaining to its lungs. If you have a sedentary lifestyle, 90725 is the perfect model, simply because it is not fit to do extremely strenuous exercise all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“What are some of the other defects?” I ask, looking closer at the body. The curvature at the hips is just my taste. Slim, but also somewhat shapely. “I want to avoid problems with the skin at all costs.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“It says here that 90725 is inclined to have rosacea. Of course, it’s only inclined to, but nothing is for certain. Although rosacea can be treated with topical medicine, if you don’t want to deal with any skincare then maybe we should move to the next donor.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I’ve been transferred to a one with skin problems before,” I tell him. My second vessel was a nightmare and I could only use it for about a decade before it started giving me too much trouble. “I would prefer not to repeat that experience.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">He smiles and moves around the potential donors, filing away some and bringing others to the front. “Completely understood.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The consultant pulls up another potential donor. “This line is one of our more popular ones,” he says. “Number 35281. Perfect skin. Comes from a line of naturally clear genes.” It’s physically similar to the last but a little shorter and a little curvier. Its eyes are light. But nothing really stands out about it, lacking something that I can’t put my finger on. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I feel like I’ve seen this model around,” I note. “Like, a lot.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“The donors in this line aren’t too genetically differentiable so that’s probably why you have.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I think I’d prefer it if I didn’t have such a…”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Popular line?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">“Well, yes. A lesser-known line would definitely be ideal,” I say. The vessel I’m in now is a part of a line that only had a hundred or so produced. I don’t look like anyone I know, </span><span class="c0">don’t</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;look like anyone in general, and there’s something that satisfies my narcissistic urge to be unique. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">He gives me a knowing look. “You’re privy to a limited-edition model.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Well, yes,” I smile. “Something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">“Let me check,” he says, rapidly </span><span class="c0">swiping</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;through the hologram. He pauses. “And you want a similar look to your current vessel?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“That would be ideal.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He nods and resumes his filtration. </span><span class="c0">I</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;look down and observe the quiet. The water is clear, almost akin to a glass floor. I close my eyes and hear the water move. It satiates my nerves. A sense of awareness moves throughout my body and I am suddenly aware of the sensations blooming at the tips of my fingers and the bottom of my feet. Now, this—this is a human feeling. Sometimes I have to remind myself that I have the luxury of feeling, these tactile sensations are a gift to me. To taste, to touch, to smell, to hear, to see, to love, to cry, to every trait that makes me a human? It’s a privilege that I have. I take a deep breath in, an aromatic gust filling my lungs. I can taste it on my tongue. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I catch a glimpse of myself in the corner glitch of the simulation. Being human—at what point am I not? My mouth goes sour. In the midst of transferring to a new vessel, I am just a consciousness being uploaded to a computer. And I am placed in a donor, a donor whose life was never an option for them to choose. Humanity is a human concept until it isn’t. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I shift uncomfortably in my seat and tense up. My selfishness is enough to stop me from jumping out of this chair and leaving. However, the sound of waves no longer soothe this agitation within me, only making me more anxious. Is it really me who’s hearing or some contrived idea of me?</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">It feels like I poisoned myself, and thinking about it makes me not want to, but every time I try to rid myself of the thought, it somehow crawls deep beneath its skin and sits there. Waiting. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">A clear of the throat. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Ms. Speckerman-21?” I open my eyes. “I think I found one that’ll suit your taste.”</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">My transfer is set two weeks after my consultation. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The donor is eighteen and somewhat average in its looks, but non-conventional. To me, that’s better than a traditionally beautiful donor; the most embarrassing thing is if you see someone on the streets that looks exactly like you. I will have no such problem with this one. Its eyes are obsidian and a little too far apart and its nose is short and small. Its hair is the color of a dark-roasted espresso, like all my other vessels and it has a mole on the corner of its bowed lips. Perhaps it isn’t the most gorgeous model out there, but it’s one that I instantly knew that I wanted when the consultant had shown it to me. Something about this donor resonated with me. I had signed the papers not even five minutes after seeing it. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I tell Callie the news and she’s more than delighted. “Finally,” she says. “We’ll be around the same age again, you grandma.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I’m embraced again. She smells sweet, as always. When she pulls away, Callie takes my hands in hers to do a little dance, our feet jumping in little circles. She’s happy for me, more elated that I’m finally letting go of this body. She doesn’t ask what changed, nor would I really be able to answer her if she did anyway. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">A stroke, her soft hand against my cheek. I lean into it and catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror to smile at my reflection. My current vessel has been one of my favorites, simply because it was easy to live in. And it still is, but even if this much is true, it’s time that I transfer into a new vessel. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">It’s funny that Callie and I are sisters of some sort, but we look nothing like each other. It makes sense—our relations, genetically, are obsolete. My genes come from one of the parents’ pairings and Callie’s come from the others’. Couples of four were popular back then, but that was when polygamy was still in the midst of becoming socially acceptable. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">From what they told us when we were young, they drew sticks to see who would be paired with who to create a baby. Mother 1 was with Father 2 for Callie and Mother 2 with Father 1 for me. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">They always liked to gloat about the trials and tribulations they went through, but Callie and I were quick to learn that they didn’t </span><span class="c0 c3">really</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;do anything other than give their reproductive ingredients to a lab. But that was a while ago, something that we both don’t really discern all too well. Our parents have long passed and were assisted together in a nice, quiet ceremony off the coast of some beach town. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I keep staring at myself in the mirror, trying to see if I’ve retained any of the traits of our parents. My original vessel was somewhat of a mixture between my second donor and the current one, but also the worst looking out of all the vessels I’ve inhabited. Perhaps, I’ve discarded away any resemblance to my parents. My reflection feels strangely empty. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I don’t look like someone I know, but perhaps that’s a good thing. Perhaps not. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Call it not really knowing who you are. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Call it insecurity. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Call it wishing that you were something other than yourself. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">All of a sudden, I feel like an intruder in this body because this is not mine. I am not completely me. But at the same time, I am. Because I can’t be anything other than the person staring back at me in the mirror, can’t possibly be anyone other than Juno. But the reflection says something different. And the closer I look, the more I look like a stranger. It sends a shiver up my spine. And I force my gaze away from myself, no—a vision of who I think I am. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">So I look to Callie for reassurance, for any kind of grounding. She stares back at me, eyelashes fluttering innocently. I’m left more unsettled. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Really, the only thing that’s changed with her is her. Everytime I talk to her she feels more and more like a shell of the Callie I remember, the one I’ve crafted in my head. It’s hard to really say that because she looks the part. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Unlike me, she, on the other hand, has always been inclined to choose unique, but stunningly pretty donors. She was born beautiful and had taken it as a central personality trait, to my distaste and her delight. To be fair, it was a natural absorption. It’s usual practice that you choose donors that are close in physical appearance to your original body, although very few, some like to completely change their appearance because of some reason or another. For some reason, I wish I had gone with the latter. Each transfer always leaves me feeling staler than the last. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">But Callie’s always had some sort of fiery red hair, some airbrush spray of freckles across her face, and some form of a slender build. I’ve always been darker, in my skin, hair, and eyes. People used to look at us and say this: “Calypso, like the sun. Juno, like the moon.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I hope they still do.</span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">I </span><span class="c0">wake</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;up in a cold sweat the day before the transfer. My bed is completely wet and I turn off my dream pod. I stumble my way towards the bathroom and strip the soaked clothes off of my body. I don’t even remember what I was dreaming about, but I’m sick to my stomach. So I kneel in front of the toilet.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">All I remember is the look of disgust, but only the shadow of it. I can’t even see their faces. I only see mine.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">You sicken me, they had mouthed. And I had just stood there, waiting for them to say something else, anything else, but they had just stared at me with those cold eyes and those disappointed, disgusted, and loveless faces. Even now, the memory is as clear as reality. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">It makes me cry. Tears run down the sides of my face and I’m hiccuping and looking at the light, trying to get myself to stop sobbing like a child, to get myself to calm down because I should be past this by now, but I can’t and I shiver uncontrollably. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I haunt my own subconsciousness. I know I will always be here, waiting. The sick thing is that I still love myself, love myself just as much as I did back then. And if I didn’t have that part of me, that part that loved myself so much, I don’t think that I would be who I am. I would be like Callie, so far removed from herself. I would merely be a shell of Juno. Or maybe, not even Juno at all.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I lean against the wall, naked. The tiles are cold against my back and the glass reflects an obscured image of myself. I look closer to see my body sagging and my spotted skin wrinkling and I watch in horror as my body swallows itself whole until it is no longer. I sob even harder. </span></p>
<p class="c5"><span class="c1 c0">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The room is sterile and white. I’m shaking in the seat and won’t stop tensing up. It’s like my body knows I’ll be transferring and wants me to stay. And I want to as well, but any longer and I’d be at my deathbed.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0 c1">“Relax,” Callie tells me. “It’s going to be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I know,” I say. “I know that. It’s just… it’s been a while.” </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The last thing I want to do is to tell her about my episode yesterday, in fear that she might start worrying about me again. Bursting out into tears after I saw a protest was already enough for her to be on alert. But it’s always the same feeling that happens right before a transfer. I’m reminded of the horrid sliver of morals I have left and the floodgates open. And I can’t live with the feeling anymore, this overwhelming feeling of guilt. Because each time I keep myself in tact, my self-hatred comes right along with me in the next body. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“It really has,” she says. “But I know that you’re going to be fine. You’re always worrying about nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I smile weakly. “Right.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The attendant comes in a few moments after and asks Callie to leave. She gives me a small kiss on the forehead and tells me not to worry one more time before exiting the room. The door materializes and becomes a part of the wall. I’m locked in, there’s no leaving now. I lean back into the chair and try to steady my breath.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Ms. Speckerman-21,” the attendant starts, pulling up in a swivel chair next to me. “I just have to ask you a few questions before we get started. Go over some procedurals.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I nod. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“It says that you’ve done this before… three times now? This will be your fourth transfer?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Yes, that’s correct.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“So, I can assume that you are aware of the risks of transferring,” she says, flipping through her hologram. “But I’ll briefly go over them anyway. Protocol, of course.” I give a noise of affirmation. “Transferring is completely safe, however, there is a small chance that some malfunctions may occur during the process. This includes, but is not limited to rejection by the donor body, loss of memory, and false rewiring of the dendrites in which, will result in serious injury and permanent conscience damage.” </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She’s talking about other side effects, but I’ve stopped listening. The images she’s showing me are frightening. People with blood gorging out of their eyes, mouths, and ears, completely fried in the brain. People with a permanent, stunned look on their faces, unable to talk and move. I admit, seeing the possible effects of a procedure gone wrong makes me feel a little less confident in the idea of transferring, even though I know it’s extremely unlikely to even happen. Still, I feel uneasy. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Ms. Speckerman-21, can you confirm?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I blink. “Sorry, what?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Can you confirm that you understand these risks and still wish to proceed in the transferring?”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I, uh,” I stumble. “I… yes.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She gives me a weird look, pursing her lips together, before typing something out on her hologram. “Are you sure?” the attendant asks after she’s done. “You don’t seem completely sure or ready yet. We want our clients to feel as safe and secure with their decision as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“No, no. I am sure,” I say with a little bit more confidence, even if it’s feigned. “I want to go through with it.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Alright. Just sign here,” I do. “And date here,” I sign again. “And you’re all set. The doctor will be here in a few moments. Please get undressed and try to… relax. You need a calm mind for a successful transfer. If you need to, there are some nasal drips that will aid with that.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Thank you,” I say softly. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“You’re welcome. I’ll be in to help you when you’re done.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She types in a couple more things into the hologram and then suddenly, I’m left alone in a room without any doors. It’s intimidating and scary enough, but being in here alone is utterly terrifying. I grab some of the nasal drops and shakily drop some into my nose and instantly, my muscles relax and I’m thrust into a headspace. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Oh,” I say to myself. “That’s nice. Nothing to worry about.” I drop a few more in. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Perhaps it’s a little too much because all of a sudden, I’m having an out-of-body experience and I can no longer control my physical movements at all. A giggle escapes my throat and I cover it, not wanting anything else to leave. But the thought of that makes me laugh even harder and I can’t stop laughing, almost painfully, as I stare at the blank ceiling moving above me, tears in my eyes slipping down the slopes of my cheeks to the floor. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The door manifests and a woman in a white coat walks in. Her mouth is covered by a mask, but her eyes are bright blue. Maybe a little too blue. And they’re moving towards me and I gasp for a tiny breath of air through the forced smile plastered across my face. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“Hello, Juno.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I try to calm down and manage to get out a greeting in between my giggles.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“I see you’ve discovered the nasal drops,” she says as she sits down and moves closer to me. She grabs the bulbous contraption hanging above me and fastens it to the top of my head. It feels weird and uncomfortable and nothing like I remember from the last time I got transferred, but my brain’s all fuzzy and feels melted so I don’t know what I am exactly feeling anymore. And I can’t stop crying. “I’m just going to give you a little something so you’re a little bit more… complacent.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The doctor places a strip under my nose and I instantly stop squirming and talking, all together. “There you go,” she placates. “All good now.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I take in a sharp breath. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“You’re okay,” the doctor connects the wires from the contraption to a large supercomputer. “Just breathe, Juno.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">She starts typing on the hologram and I slowly lose feeling in my toes and then it travels upward. “We’re going to bring in your donor now.” I can no longer feel my arms. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The door manifests open once more and I see them wheel in my vessel, as naked as myself. We look similar. But maybe a little too much; she looks like a younger version of my original form. She looks like she’s just resting, as if someone had taken her from her bed and into this room, without waking her. And the thought of that makes me want to vomit. I hadn’t realized why I chose this donor until now and hadn't recognized the subtle similarities between her and the body I was born in. She looks just like me. She may as well be me. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">That’s the thing: I could be her in another life and she could be me. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">And</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;suddenly, the idea of that makes my chest hurt a little bit too much, despite my lack of perceived feeling in it. I try to close my eyes, but I can’t. They’re forced open, tears streaming down my cheeks but I can’t feel any of the wetness, can’t feel the humanness. All I can do is watch as the attendants carry her limp body into the chair next to mine and strap her up the same way they’ve done to me. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">I try to convince myself: this is all okay. It’s the medicine, the relaxers, that’s making me spiral into this descent of regret. I tell myself that she’s unconscious and not human at all, tell myself that I am not the same as her. Repeat Callie’s words in my head. Repeat my own words in my head. But all that comes out are his words. His cruel, truthful words. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Because I know in my heart, deep down within my consciousness that this body in front of me is not mine. It is not mine to have, but I will have it. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Because I just got lucky. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Because my whole self is formed because of the fertilization of my parents’ reproductive cells colliding at a specific time and a specific place. If it had been done a second later or a second before, I wouldn’t be here—no, this body besides my own, it could have been me. I could have been the donor. I could have been the shell of a human, waiting for her conscience to fill me. I could have been the one without a voice, without thoughts. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Or even worse, I wouldn’t exist at all.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">And this feeling overwhelms me because I don’t want to do it anymore, can’t fathom forcing myself into that body next to me—don't want to go through with anything, but it’s too late because I can’t talk, I can’t even move. I’m locked in a prison that I can’t escape without killing myself in the process. This vessel, this body, this girl—she’s something—someone and I am everything, yet nothing. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">There’s clicks, many of them. I’m being clasped in. So is she. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">“You’ll be there in no time, Juno.”</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">The doctor leans in over me and puts on a covering against my eyes so the darkness consumes my vision and the last thing I see before I lose myself within myself is the blackened face of that protester, ripping off her skin to reveal a ghostly shadow of my own consciousness.</span></p>
