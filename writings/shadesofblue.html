            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It’s a cool, autumnal Friday evening and the air smells like wet foliage. His roommates are throwing a rager, as they’d call it, for no reason other than the fact that they had bought too much alcohol and wanted to rip-off some unassuming freshmen for a nice chunk of change. They’re always losing money on these parties so Elijah doesn’t know why they even bother, but the night’s still young and there's a steady stream of people arriving with their lazy, lopsided grins and bumbling words. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He’s been hiding in the kitchen at the back of the house, munching on Wes’s week-old cake and listening to the crackles and pops of the windblown trees through an open window. Muffled trap music hums through the walls and the occasional shrill laugh leaks its way in too. His feet are dangling off the counter, left shoelace untied.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door swings open, revealing an inebriated Jamie. His eyes are bloodshot and he has this silly, sleepy smile on his face. Elijah doesn’t know if he got laid or if he’s just high. Maybe both. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I knew you’d be here.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah snorts, shoving a mouthful of pure frosting in. It’s all hardened and gross, but Wes ate the last of his jamón the day before, so he felt the need to make a point. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You know what it means,” Jamie replies, digging into their designated liquor cabinet to get another handle of Bacardi. He waves it around, the clear liquid jostling. “Come out of this gremlin hole with me. Do a shot or two. Don’t make me drag you out again, Eli. We might be playing some pong soon in the backyard and God forbid anyone sees you acting like a little weirdo in here, all cooped up in here by yourself.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You know I hate these things.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He waves his hand dismissively. “Everyone’s asking where you are tonight.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Tell them I’m at the library.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jamie unscrews the cap and pours way more than a shot into a solo cup. “Very cool books you got there.” He motions at the cake’s plastic container. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah shrugs, digging another forkful of cake out. “I doubt they really care anyway.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well, I care.” Jamie slides the cup over to Elijah and steals the fork from him in one swift maneuver. “Cheers, mate.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh, for fuck’s sake.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The rum is absolutely vile and burns his throat and nose. He winces and smacks his mouth together quickly to get rid of the taste, but it doesn’t help and he gags. Jamie’s always trying to get him to drink and every time he gives in, he regrets it immediately. Elijah hops off the counter to wash down the bitter taste with a glass of lemonade. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Shit, man,” Jamie laughs. “You’re such a lightweight.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Get off my dick.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jamie pours himself one of the same size and downs it casually, as if taking a swig of water. A breeze comes through the window and kisses Elijah’s skin. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You coming out or what?” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jamie’s looking at him expectantly with those big puppy dog eyes of his. Elijah sighs. “Do I have to?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“It would be nice,” Jamie says, putting down the handle delicately. He has a look on his face, one that makes Elijah feel a bit guilty. “But I won’t make you if you don’t wanna.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah wouldn’t admit it, but he enjoys spending time with himself the most, something he inherited a few years ago. It had been a hectic week, his desk piled high with assignments, turning him into more of a hermit than usual, only really emerging to eat and piss. When he did find his way to the kitchen, he would catch glimpses of his friends in the dining room, all of them around the table and he would scramble back to his room, cheeks red, like he wasn’t ever there. It was more of an instinct than anything. Sometimes he could hear them from his room, hearty laughs and obscene screams, and his stomach would turn itself inside out. He didn’t understand why it made him feel like this, but it did. Not that it mattered though. They were all closer with each other anyway.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah says nothing but Jamie must be able to read it in his face. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jamie grins, whipping out a glass. It clinks against the countertop. “That’s my boy. Wanna ‘nother shot?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah brushes a hand through his hair. It’s still damp from his shower hours ago. “I’m good. Thanks though.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“See ya out there. Cal wanted me to make him a gin and tonic. Stupid bastard probably wouldn’t notice if it was just some Sprite, eh?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah nods and pushes his way out of the kitchen and into the packed hallway, greased and steamed with sweat. Drinks spill everywhere—on him, on the floor, on the walls. He wrinkles his nose thinking about the morning after. There’s no way in hell he’ll be the one cleaning it and he knows Jamie won’t either. Poor Wes. The party wasn’t even his idea. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The living room is where most of his friends are, dimly lit by the cheap blue LED light strips taped to the edges of the ceiling. They’re playing some sort of drinking game with cards on the coffee table, Callum and Kai on the floor, and Wes standing over them with a Busch Light in hand. It’s one that they play often and one that Elijah has watched a lot of but has never bothered to learn. He has no interest in their silly black out games.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Eli!” Callum hollers. “You’ve finally come out of your lair. Guys, look. Eli is here.” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We see him too, Cal, pipe down,” Kai laughs, laying down a card. It’s the queen of diamonds. “Drink.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Fuck,” Callum slaps his thigh and takes a swing of his beer. It dribbles down the side of his mouth and he wipes the excess on the sleeve of his shirt. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Cal here is desperately losing,” Wes explains in a hushed voice. “He’s guessing things that have already all been played before.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You’re expecting him to count cards?” Elijah raises both his eyebrows and blinks. “Him?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I would,” Wes shrugs. “It’s really the only way to win.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Red,” Callum screams. “Red, red, red.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai turns the card over. It’s the ace of spades. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No way. No fucking—”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“How was your week?” Wes asks. “I feel like I’ve barely seen you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Kinda rough,” Elijah says. It was more than rough. He pulled two all-nighters and barely turned in all of his work before the deadlines. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“How long did your paper end up being?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Too long,” Elijah says. “What about you?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Same old. School’s dogshit. Although…” he trails off, clearly wanting Elijah to ask. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I invited my lab partner and her friends to come over tonight.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh,” Elijah smiles. He means it. “You must be excited.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes shrugs nonchalantly, but he’s smiling too. “I don’t know, I guess. We’re just hanging out.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“When are they supposed to get here?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Any time now, actually—” Wes’s eyes widen as he looks past Elijah at the door. “I think they’re coming in now. Yeah, that’s them.” He gives him a pat on the back. “I’ll be right back.” He says something else, but Elijah doesn’t quite catch it and by the time he tries to ask, Wes is already gone. His palms sweat a bit. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">To his right, Callum’s on the floor on the verge of tears and Kai’s laughing at him, flipping over another card. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Please, end my suffering,” Callum whines to no one in particular. “I can’t do this anymore.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai glances at Elijah with a wicked smirk, and then back at Callum. “Is the little baby tired of losing? Is the little baby weak?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Yes,” he cries. “Yes, I am!”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’ll let you go if Eli takes over,” Kai grins. “But only Eli.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No way. That’s evil. That’s pure evil. You know Eli hates these types of games. That's fucked.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I don’t—” he interjects. They both stare at him. “I don’t hate them… I’m not feeling this one tonight.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We can play something else, then,” Kai suggests, collecting the deck into his hand. “Perhaps a little truth or dare?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Not too sure about that one either.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Why not a quick game?” Callum says. “You never hang with us.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I do, it’s just—” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Just what?” Kai laughs, blinking. “Don’t you want to know some of our dirty little secrets? Callum here has done some dark shit that you would definitely—”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Shut up, Kai.” Callum slurs, slamming the table. “This is not about me. It’s Eli’s turn.” He turns to Elijah. “Truth or dare?” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rap music blasts in the background as they both look at him expectantly. Panic washes over him and he’s left with an icy sensation behind his ears. He makes some pathetic excuse. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai shrugs, disappointed. “That’s really too bad,” he says, turning to Cal. He lays out the cards again. “Red or black?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah slowly backs away from the scene. He wishes that he could get over himself. He knows they mean well and knows that he’ll never be close to him if he keeps pushing them away like this, but it’s too frightening. Friendships aren’t made to last forever, and when they burn, they burn bad. Elijah likes to think he knows how to contain the flames.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stumbles from room to room aimlessly, pretending to be looking for someone. The flashing lights, wet heat from bodies, and smell of weed are overwhelming. It’s tiring and he wishes he told Jamie that he was too exhausted to socialize so he could just curl up in bed, forget the whole thing. It’s not too late to back out, to lament sorely about his sleep deprivation with sad eyes and retreat back to his room unscathed, but he doesn’t. Because he wants to keep his word. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The house is more crowded than he’s ever seen it and every space holds people he doesn’t recognize. It makes him feel a little smaller than he’d like, but he would never tell his roommates that. He knows how much these parties lift their spirits, especially how crazy they become at the crux of the night.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A group of girls brush past him, bumping shoulders with him awkwardly. They don’t apologize, don’t even notice he’s there. It makes him feel worse for some reason and before he can think too much about it, he focuses on seeking out Wes. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He’s always felt the closest to Wes. They were roommates freshman year and Elijah’s not sure if he would have ever made it out of the dorm room without Wes’s natural charisma and overt friendliness. There’s a bit of comfort in sticking with Wes because of how he carries the conversation and doesn’t mind that Elijah’s just there, doesn’t really goad him into talking like most people do.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah finds him in the backyard, standing in a circle with three girls. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes meets his eyes knowingly and waves him over. “Eli!” He has the stupidest grin on his face. “Come here. I wanna introduce you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walks over, hands shoved in pockets and Wes wraps an arm around his shoulder. “Ladies, this is my roommate, Elijah. But everyone calls him Eli.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hi,” he says. He can barely see their faces in the dark. “Nice to meet y’all.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Eli, this is my lab partner, Sara, and her friends, Millie and Manami.” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two of the girls give small, shy waves. Sara is pretty and petite, with muted blonde hair and thick eyelashes framed by thin, circular glasses. Manami is taller, with hair going down to her ribs. She wears thick eyeliner that stretches past the edges of her eyes. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other girl, Millie, feels familiar but he can’t quite place where he’s seen her before. She has sunken, cut cheekbones and big brown eyes and a mysterious half-smile that makes him squint, not sure if it’s really there. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah stares. She just has one of those faces.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn’t say anything about recognizing her, afraid to embarrass himself. It doesn’t matter anyway because she’s not looking at him. Doesn’t even acknowledge him. Just listens shallowly to Wes’s boisterous, baritone voice, her glossed eyes clearly elsewhere. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“The girls were just telling me about a drink they like to make. What is it called? Skinny-Go-Dippin’?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sara laughs. It’s nasal, but pretty. “Strip-And-Go-Nakeds.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes proceeds to list out the ingredients of the drink as if it’s the best thing he’s heard as if reciting the words of Jesus himself. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah keeps his eyes on Millie. She’s wearing heavy makeup, dark, raccoon eyeshadow and painted ruby lips. The more he looks at Millie, the more she looks like somebody he used to know, or at least some obscured carnival mirror version of her. He feels lightheaded just thinking about it. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The memory of her face is quite dim. At least, he’d like to tell himself that. He can feel a heat spread from the bottom of his feet upwards as if he were self-immolating. He hopes that he’s just being dumb and wistful and giving some futile bullshit more thought than it needs. For all he knows, the shot could be making him see things or the navy night could be impairing his vision. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Eli.” Wes is looking at him strangely. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Sorry, what?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“We’re going in to make these bad boys. Care to join?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He glances at Millie again. She still won’t meet his gaze fully, choosing to stare straight ahead at nothing in particular. The lights from the house illuminate the sharpness of her face and she looks younger than she means to be. She looks more familiar than she means to be. She looks exactly like her. But there’s no way that’s possible. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Eli.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Oh um, yeah. Sorry. Sure.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Alright then,” Wes forces a chuckle, giving him another look. “Let’s get to stripping and getting naked—ow, Sara, I’m kidding. Ladies, you go ahead first. Kitchen’s the first door to the right,” he says, motioning to the window framing the yellow light. “Eli, can I talk to you for a second?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes wraps an arm around him. As he’s being pulled to the side of the backyard, he hears Millie say something to one of the girls, some passing comment, but the lilt of her voice, the sound of it makes his blood run cold. He knows that voice.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c5">“Dude, what’s up with you?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Huh?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“If you’ve got a thing for her, just talk to her. It’s freaking everybody out.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No, no,” he insists, a little too quickly. He can feel his heartbeat in his ears. Wes raises an eyebrow. “Really, I don’t. She just looks like somebody…” A pause. “Somebody I used to be friends with.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Alright, but either way, you need to lay off the eyes. She’s definitely noticed.” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah opens his mouth to say something, but Wes is already moving towards the house. The slow crawl of heat reaches his face and it feels he’s been set ablaze. The thought of her, the reality of her, everything about her, haunts him. The zephyr against his skin can’t seem to fan the flames. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Holy shit.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girls giggle. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“This is liquid gold.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I know,” Sara says. “Isn’t it amazing?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You can’t even taste any of the vodka,” Wes’s eyes grow big. “We don’t even have to use the expensive shit anymore. We don’t even have to take shots. You’re an absolute godsend, Sara. I’m in love with this drink.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Don’t forget that there’s a reason for its namesake.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes and Sara keep flirting and Manami is scrolling through her phone, clearly not in the mood to talk to anyone. Elijah doesn’t even notice, he’s too busy thinking of what to do, what to say, what to even think. He wants to find her, but she’s disappeared just as fast as she came. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thought makes his stomach flip. He almost wishes it wasn't her. Almost. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He feels a tap on his shoulder. “Are you looking for her?” It’s Manami, slender fingers suspended over her phone. She’s looking at him like she already knows the answer.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Huh?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“She told me she knew you.” Manami says coolly, flipping her hair over her shoulder. “Camille is upstairs, I think. She wanted to smoke.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“She said that?” He feels his throat tighten. Manami says something, but he doesn’t hear her, doesn’t hear anything anymore except for the soft roar of an ocean. His breath catches in his throat and he feels like he’s drowning. Out of the blurriness of his eyes, he sees Wes come up to him, furrowed brow and all, and feels the strong grip on his biceps pushing him backwards into the hallway. The soft yellow light darkens and darkens until Wes’s face turns blue. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Eli,” Wes tries to make direct eye contact with him. “What’s going on?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He swallows air. “It’s nothing.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Clearly it’s not,” Wes states. “Sara’s friend. You said she was an old friend. What did you mean by that?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Exactly what you think,” Elijah says, breath getting shorter with every inhale. He doesn’t want to talk about it. He can’t talk about it. “I don’t know why you’re asking me this in the first place.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Cause you’re being fucking weird about it! I just wanted you to have a good time, hang out with us or whatever version that is for you and you’re still being—” Wes stops himself and lets go of Elijah with open palms. He looks tired. “I just want to be supportive, that’s all.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I don’t need any crutching, I don’t need anything, I’m fine,” Elijah replies coolly. He doesn’t feel fine. He feels like he’s going to explode. “Really, I’m good.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wes stares at him. “Fine. Suit yourself.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He watches Wes disappear into the frame, door closing on his heels. Elijah can barely breathe. His ears feel hot and his heart skips a beat, then two. But it’s nothing in comparison to what he’s felt before, what she’s made him feel. He’s flooded with a feeling of something, something akin to dread, anger, and hurt. But not even that can describe it. It’s overwhelming.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A group of people rush into the kitchen, laughing. He presses himself against the wall, wiping his wet palms on his pants. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The thought of seeing her makes him want to laugh and cry at the same time. He’s desperate to see if she’s the same girl he remembers, the same girl he’s been wondering about all these years, but at the same time, doesn’t know if he’ll be able to handle being in the same room with her. Doesn’t know if he can handle tearing open wounds he’s glued shut. He’s not sure how he'd even start the conversation.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks towards the door and then the stairs. If he doesn’t do anything, say anything, it’ll haunt him forever. He knows this much to be true. So Elijah turns into the crowd and lets it swallow him whole. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He finds her in their attic, Jamie’s bedroom. Her hair is bleach blonde but looks almost blue in the moonlight, something he didn’t realize wasn’t natural in the darkness of the backyard. She’s squatting by the window, her reflection watching him carefully, unsurprised. She has a blunt hanging out from the side of her mouth and when she sees him, she turns to blow a ring of smoke in his face. Her eyes are wild and gold in the luminescence of the night. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You’re not allowed to smoke in here.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Sorry,” she says, but she doesn’t put it out. Instead, she takes a drag. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few beats of silence pass. She’s so thin, much thinner than before and more than he could have ever imagined. No wonder he couldn’t recognize her—she looks weightless, almost like a spirit. Like she doesn’t exist. They don’t break eye contact and Elijah doesn’t want to look away, doesn’t want to blink, in fear that if he does, she’ll disappear into the air just like the smoke expelling from her mouth.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I can’t believe it’s you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Ah.” Another inhale and exhale. “Well, I’m not sure what to say to that.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stares at her. “What are you doing here?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What do you mean?” she asks. Her dress is short, revealing bruised knees that look like they’d been painted with muddy watercolor. “I go to school here.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Yeah, no shit. I thought you moved.” Thought you were dead, he wants to add, but doesn’t. &nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I did,” she takes another drag and pushes herself up to sit on the windowsill. Despite her cool demeanor, her hands shake in the slightest way. “But then my parents got divorced and my mom wanted to be back with her friends, family, or whatever. So, I came back with her.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Why didn’t you ever text? Call? You had my number.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Lost it,” she replies. He grips the sleeves of his sweater, palms sweaty. It feels itchy against his skin. “Don’t think you’re special, Eli. I lost contact with everyone.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Am I supposed to believe that?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well,” she shrugs, taking a hit. “I don’t know what else there is to do.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He narrows his eyes. His head feels like it's been pumped with helium. “I spent all those years wondering what happened to you. Turns out you’ve been here the entire time?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Don’t exaggerate, Eli,” she says, tapping the ash onto the floor. Her foot rubs it into the carpet. “I don’t even remember half of the shit we did.” I do, he wants to yell. I remember.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Camille stares at him blankly, her mouth formed in a little crimson “o” as she takes another drag.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well, it was nice to see you, I guess,” he says numbly. He’s halfway out the door when she calls his name. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Elijah turns and grips the doorframe, trying to anchor himself. The stray hairs that slip out from her ponytail frame her face and she looks unreal, like a ghostly beauty Caravaggio would paint. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I just…” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Silence eats the space. Camille looks at her feet.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I really did miss you.” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stares. “Right.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah stumbles into the nearest bathroom, flipping the switch on and locking the door behind him. It smells like somebody just finished hotboxing the room, and whoever did had the courtesy to leave a crack in the window. The light flickers for a second then hues the room with a fluorescent haze. There’s an empty bottle of beer on the sink counter.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stares at himself in the mirror. The person staring back at him doesn’t look real, doesn’t feel like him. Elijah doesn’t remember what he looked like back when he used to know himself. He can barely remember what he looks like now. His skin looks translucent, looks blued and sick. He feels sick. It’s been years since he’d last seen Camille, but like a nightmare, she’s back to haunt him. And she’s changed. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tears well in his eyes and he grips the sides of the sink. He had spent time and effort in repairing himself, just for her to show up and act like they were strangers. To act like she couldn’t give more than two shits about him and his life. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He’s suddenly thirteen and angry at her for leaving, all over again. He feels stupid, so dumb for thinking that she had actually cared about him. Because if she did, she wouldn’t have acted like that tonight. She wouldn’t have left him in radio silence for all of those years. And she wouldn't have left without saying goodbye.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah wants to run back and ask her everything. Get answers. Understand why. But as he stares at himself in the mirror, those fragile adolescent eyes look right back at him and plead. She’s already done enough. He should know better than to wish for things that only will tear him apart. He picks at the grime under his nails and stares at the sink drain. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not this time. He won’t let himself. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The party is still rolling at top speed when he gets downstairs. Callum’s passed out on the couch and Kai’s drawing Sharpie tattoos all over his body, passing around the pen to any drunk girl nearby. In the corner, Jamie’s chatting up this girl on the side, leaning in a little too close, holding her waist, doing all the things that give him the reputation he has across campus. And Wes is probably somewhere off with Sara. Probably still pissed with him too.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah doesn’t feel like talking with any of them or even pretending to want to. He pushes his way to the door and grabs his keys, the cool metal melting in his sweaty hand. A bunch of people are hanging by the entrance, all of them strangers and everything feels so foreign and he just wants something that he recognizes, something real. He feels dizzy.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Hey, where are you going?” A hand grips his bicep, pulling him back.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah blinks at Jamie, embarrassed to be caught in the act. “I just needed some fresh air.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You look kinda pale. You alright?” He’s slurring his words, just a bit. His hair is reflecting the blue light from the living room and he’s a bit blurry as he moves. “Cause the party’s just getting started. Can’t leave yet.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m fine. Worry about yourself.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jamie laughs, slapping his back. He wobbles a bit. “I’m just peachy, don’t you turn the tables.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Yeah, alright,” he says. He absentmindedly touches his cheeks. They’re damp. “I’ll be back soon.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He spins to leave, but Jamie pulls him back around. “Hey, but who was that chick? Wes’s girlfriend’s friend? Becca said she saw you follow her into some room or something.” He lowers his voice. “Did y’all fuck?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No, we didn’t,” Elijah replies, trying to keep his voice steady. He shakes Jamie’s grasp off. “And she’s nobody.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Yeah, sure fucking seemed like it,” Jamie winks. It pisses him off. “I’ll let you go, you little rascal. But you come right back home to papa in fifteen minutes, tops. The boys are going to be doing more shots and it’s mandatory that you’re there or else there’s gonna be a double shot penalty. You hear me?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Sure, whatever.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Atta boy!” Jamie slaps his back again and stumbles back to the living room, his lady friend for the night immediately filling the space under his arm. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The party can be heard from a block away. Elijah wonders briefly if he should let his roommates know—after all, the neighbors get a little feisty when they throw things on the weeknights. The police already know Jamie on a first name basis. They’ve still never gotten a citation. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The neighborhood is quiet otherwise. The leaves are just starting to crisp up and fall from the trees, curled yellow things riding the waves of wind. He loves autumn, loves how new it feels. Elijah never really understood why spring was always pedestaled as the season of new beginnings. He’s always hated spring. For him, it’s always been fall, with its fresh air and changing colors. Plus, it’s especially nice for walks, clearing the head, and getting away from the busyness of life. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He walks past the houses filled with strangers and their little secrets and the stores that are long past closed until he reaches the playground at the edge of the neighborhood. He sits on the bottom of the slide, its static shocking his clothes, lays down and closes his eyes.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wishes that he could stop thinking about her. Wishes he could stop blaming her. Elijah’s toes curl in his shoes.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He can barely remember the day she upped and left, but he remembers the feeling. He remembers the way it felt to be alone, truly alone. He remembers how that feeling became his new best friend. He remembers eating in the classroom alone, the sideways glances from the teachers, the staring contest with the clock. He remembers climbing into the oak tree in his backyard and closing his eyes. Most of all, he remembers not being afraid anymore. He remembers the crack, the pause, and then the scream and how his mother’s eyes looked when she found him, so fucking blue and so fucking sad. He remembers staring at himself in the mirror and feeling nothing and smiling until he did. He remembers pretending to be Elijah, a better Elijah, and how it worked because look at all the friends he has, look how happy he is, look how he still cries at the drop of a pin and no matter what he does, how he’s still alone.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The night sky is the darkest shade of blue.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The breeze gnaws at his skin and his knobby fingers clutch the inside of his sweater to hold the remainder of his body heat in. It isn’t enough. He exhales slowly, trying to sedate his breath. His eyes feel a bit moist. As much as he loves the night, it’s comforting to know that the sun will always be there in the morning.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He hears the soft sound of footsteps approaching, the click of heels against concrete. Elijah opens his eyes to see Camille hovering over him. Her hair is now down and some of it tickles his cheek for a second. It smells like lavender and weed. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Wes said you’d be here.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn’t respond, just stares at her.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I wanted to talk.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Why?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sits down on a swing and pushes herself off so she’s swaying slightly with the breaths of the breeze. “I owe you an explanation.” </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Do you?” he asks, propping himself up on his forearms. The static tries to bite. “We can just go on living our lives like nothing’s changed. Cause nothing has.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She doesn’t say anything for a moment; then, “If you don’t wanna hear it, you don’t have to listen. But you deserve something.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m sure you had your reasons.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Then, let me tell you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Camille starts from the beginning. Elijah listens, pretending not to, but he does. She tells him how her father and mother were sad, cracked people under their porcelain skin, how everything crumbled in the span of a single month. She tells him how her father stopped coming home one night and the way she would wait to hear the car motor in the garage that never came. The way he vanished left her with this indescribable feeling, this deep-rooted hurt that she thought she was going to die from and then, nothing at all. She thought that it was better than missing someone you knew you could never have.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She tells him of the blurriness of her mother’s eyes, the faintness of her voice, and how she felt as though she couldn’t hold her mother in her arms without fearing that she’d disappear into dust. She tells him how one day, she was tugged out of her bed and suddenly was in a car a hundred miles away leaving their sad, sick town. Nobody seemed noticed anyway, nobody except him. She never knew how to tell him goodbye. She tells him how she bathed in guilt, and how she’s never fully dried from it, that is, until she saw him today. That is, until now. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah feels like he’s about to throw up. He looks at her and he’s drowning, these waves swallow him and wash over his face with salty licks. Her mouth keeps moving, but he no longer registers what she says. It sounds like regret. His own. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You can imagine how surprised I was to see you at the party. I knew you went here and—”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Wait,” he interrupts. It’s the first time he’s said anything since she started talking. Her eyes widen. “You knew.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Well, yeah. Word of mouth, y’know?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You didn’t even want to reach out then?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She grips the chains of the swing, knuckles white. “I thought you wouldn’t have cared. I thought you might hate me. I thought a lot of things and those things told me that you wouldn’t have wanted to see me.” She looks up at the sky, a small laugh escaping her lips. “I didn’t know if you even remembered me.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I would have dropped everything to see you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She glances at her feet.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You were the only one I trusted,” he continues. “You were my only friend.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I know. I’m sorry.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Then I don’t understand,” he says. His fingertips tingle, numb from the cold. “Why didn’t you want to see me again?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She sighs. “People like me aren’t made to be remembered. By morning, you’ll forget that I was even here.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I won’t.” Not by choice anyways, he thinks. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m really sorry, Eli. I was just shocked when I first saw you. I thought that it was all in my head and you looked at me and—” she shudders. “You just didn’t seem real. I didn’t know what to say. It just took me off-guard. I probably came off like a bitch—”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“A little.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“—but I did really miss you. And seeing you again has just been… You look the same.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He runs his fingers through his hair, not knowing what to say. Elijah wants to forgive her, make this foreign warmth in his heart something familiar again, but he stays there, staring at her in the cold, blue midnight. He can’t bring himself to say anything. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She bites the meat of her lower lip and sways nervously on the swing. “I hope we can be friends again, Eli,” she says carefully. Delicately. “I know we’ve probably changed in our own ways and you… I know you might not be able to forgive me anytime soon, but maybe if there’s ever a chance in the future, I’d like us to—” she stops herself, feet planting on the ground. Camille looks up to meet his strained gaze. Her eyes are lonely. Just like his. “I just really fucking missed you.”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He takes her back to her apartment, which turns out to be three blocks from the playground. Their walk back is filled with some polite small talk but mostly large gaps of silence. When they get to her place, she asks if they’ll see each other again. He says he doesn’t know. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah walks back home alone. It’s cold. He doesn’t know what to feel, but maybe he should. After hearing everything, he thought he might at least be overjoyed or bitter with resentment, but not this. Not this numbness. Because then, what was it all for?</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">All he knows is that he feels stupid, so fucking stupid for holding out on her all these years. He feels even more stupid for thinking it was about him. He feels like he’s failed his youth and trapped himself into this bottomless hole for nothing, nothing at all.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There’s no reason not to believe her. Why would she lie? He feels like he’s wasted his time on something that never existed in the first place. He feels like a recycled dream that’s a stand-in for reality. He feels like jetsam, unwanted and wanted at the same time.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wants someone to just tell him what he wants, or at least what to feel. That way, none of this would be his own choice, his own undoing. He just wants everything to be okay again, normal again, but it seems like nothing and everything, and anything seems possible, impossible, and he’s just so fucking confused.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe it’s best if he doesn’t try to dissect and pick away at himself until there’s nothing left. Because in a perfect world, he’d have someone tell him the right thing to do, but there is no such thing and there is no such world. He wants to block out everything that happened for the rest of the night. In fact, he would rather just not think about it at all. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The party is dying down when he gets back and more people are leaving than coming in. The living room looks dark from the outside, only a blush of blue coming from the lamp by the window. Red solo cups and empty beer cans sprawl across the lawn and the smell permeates through all of the rooms and lingers in the hallways where sweaty strangers smile, like they’re the happiest they’ve ever been. Maybe they are.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He finds all of his friends cornered in the kitchen, blasting their loud, trashy music and laughing about some inside joke he probably wouldn’t get. He’ll ask them about it another time.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elijah and Wes exchange knowing glances. They’ll talk about what happened later. They always do. He nestles himself into the open space between Callum and Kai and accepts a shot of God-knows-what from Jamie who gives him a curious look. He tilts his head back and lets the cool liquid ignite a fire in his stomach. It burns.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Where have you been?”</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Four pairs of eyes stare at him expectantly. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">“To be honest,” he says. “I’m not entirely sure.”</span></p>
