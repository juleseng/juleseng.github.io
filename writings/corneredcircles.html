            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was living on Mars for two and a half rotations when the population really started to grow. There were two types of people you’d meet when you’d first step foot onto the red dust: the ones with a superiority complex and the ones who would try to eat you alive. Of course I don’t mean that in a literal sense, but, it was an act to watch—they’d act all nice and butter you up only to trap you into a life’s contract of working in the air fields.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I only knew this because my friend, Maxis, got scooped up into signing himself a deal with one of the plantowners west of the Hellas Basin and I hadn’t seen him since. I got an occasional message from him on the holo, maybe once or twice a rotation, letting me know he was doing alright. If you were to talk to anyone else, they would’ve probably raved about the air industry and said I’m cynical. After all, these plants accounted for half of the employment and contributed some ridiculous number to the total revenue of Mars. Anyway, Maxis seemed like he enjoyed working there. Two months in, he claimed botany was his true passion in life. I was still a skeptic.</span></p>

Two months in, he claimed botany was his true passion in life. I was still a skeptic.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The intense mass migration to Mars was due to a single catalyst: Crimson Mining. They had found a huge germanium deposit somewhere up north of the capital and advertised a free ride to Mars in exchange for a rotation of labor. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, Crimson certainly got what they asked for. In a single day, Mars’s population had grown by a quarter of a million people. And before I knew it, the whole planet was flooded with Earthers. You could tell they weren’t from here by the way they walked and talked, as if they were better than us. But we found it more amusing than anything. They were holding their nose up all high and mighty only to come and work in the most dangerous, undesirable sector here. I mean it was kind of ridiculous. The only reason Crimson had to recruit so hard was because most Martians didn’t want to do the job. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A couple weeks after the initial boom was when I had met them. Their boxes had overflowed into the hallway and my curiosity couldn’t help but make me peek into their place. It was a carbon copy of mine, but empty. Just a big white room. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The neighbors before them were cordial, a bit reclusive for my taste. I would only see them on occasion and if we did happen to run into each other, our conversation would never progress past the weak greeting. And they’d just disappear as if they’d never been there in the first place. To be honest, I wasn’t really completely aware that they had moved out, but I couldn’t say I was surprised either. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I met the new neighbors a few days after their move-in day. They knocked on my door one Saturday evening, offering a bottle of wine and two toothy smiles. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“We’re your new neighbors. I’m Jacques and this is my wife, Celine,” the man said. “We just came over to bring a welcoming gift.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I introduced myself accordingly and welcomed them in. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I love how you did your place,” Celine smiled, putting down the bottle on my countertop. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Thanks,” I said. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was easy to tell they were from Earth for many reasons, but the most notable feature was the way they dressed. Jacques donned this crisp button-down and Celine was wearing a red dress, flashy than all the Martians combined. They looked expensive in the plainness of my own home. Although, it was more relative than reality.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“How long have you lived here?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Just two rotations, give or take.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh, then you’re from Earth originally?” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yeah. You?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">They gave each other a knowing smile. “Just got here a week ago.” She looked around. “Got a bottle opener?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I handed her one. Our fingertips brushed, her pointer finger skimming over mine ever so slightly. I rubbed my hand on the canvas of my pants as she smiled at me again. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“So, why Mars?” I asked, eyes directed at Jacques. I felt Celine looking at me from the side and frankly, it seemed a little crass. What was more unsettling was that he looked unfazed, almost unbothered by it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Ah. I’m sure you’ve heard all about it.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took three cups from my cabinet. “So you’re miners?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Well,” Celine said, looking at him. “Yes, but not exactly. Not the ones you’re thinking of anyways.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I laughed nervously and poured some wine. “Alright then.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Cheers,” Jacques lifted up his glass. “To being neighbors!”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We clinked glasses and they grinned.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Over the course of the next few weeks, I somehow cemented myself as their little third wheel. I didn’t know how it happened exactly, but I started to tag along for everything, from their flashy club trips in the eastern Valles Marineris and to their evening dinner dates in Xanthe Terra. Both didn’t seem to mind my intrusion, but rather welcomed it with open arms and would frequently pay for my part. Never in my life had I been wanted like this and it felt so good.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I really liked Jacques, in all his manliness and charming personality. He was everything I aspired to be, with his good heart and forward way of speaking. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Frankly, it was Celine who made me wary. She was bold and unapologetic and too elusive for her own good. I found that these traits were the reason I liked her, but also the ones that made me uncomfortable. See, I was skeptical about the progression of my relationship with Celine and what would become of it. I couldn’t deny that she was very stunning, almost in an ancient and mystical way. The left side of her face was far more angular than the right, but it was quite refreshing.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">It wasn’t her beauty that had me at unease. It was the way she would always sit a little too close for comfort when her partner was right there and lightly place her hand on my shoulder when she would emphasize something. Just the tiny, subtle hints of a puzzle I couldn’t quite solve that would leave me self-aware and confused for the rest of the night. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">For example, one Thursday night I was over at their place.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jacques was cooking up a storm, veal in the oven and swiss chard and risotto on the stove. His back was turned to the both of us, but he was doing the most of the talking somehow. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I mean, Martians could loosen up a bit,” he remarked. “They could learn something from home, from Earth, is all I’m saying.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You learn to understand why they’re like that,” I said, taking a sip of wine. “Trust me, you’ll be just like them in a couple of years.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“God I hope not.” Celine wrinkled her nose. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt a little offended. “What makes a Martian so different from an Earther?” I asked. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Celine laughed and put her hand on my thigh. “You’ve been here too long.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stared at her blankly. Her hand was burning an imprint into my leg. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Do you consider yourself a Martian?” she asked, inching closer. I could feel her breath on the hairs of my neck. “You think the Martians think you’re one of them?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I don’t, I—” I was at a loss for words. “I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh stop teasing him,” Jacques cut in, looking over his shoulder. By the time he caught a glimpse, Celine was back in her spot, nursing a flute of champagne in her hand. My red ears were the only evidence. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I was only joking of course,” she said plainly. “Of course you’re a Martian.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Nothing like an Earther,” Jacques agreed. “But perhaps, that’s a good thing.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh.” I blinked. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Really, you could afford to relax a bit though. Bring your blood pressure down and all,” Celine noted. “Don’t you think, honey?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jacques smiled, facing me completely. “I think he’s perfect the way he is.” He paused. “Dinner’s almost ready.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I, uh. Thanks, Jacques.” I didn’t know exactly what to say back to the strange compliment. “I appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I don’t know if I said something wrong or if they had some unresolved manners but suddenly, the air was stiff and every move I made felt like static. He didn’t reply, just turned around and kept tending to the stovetop. On top of that, Celine kept staring unabashedly, eyes lasering into the side of my face. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was confused as to how the conversation had come to such a sudden halt. A weird gut feeling told me something was up and that maybe it would be better if I left. But then Jacques let out a boisterous laugh, straight from the belly, and raised a glass to no one in particular. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“To a good, tediously prepped dinner,” he said. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I lifted my glass right back at him, repeating those same words although they felt strange and foreign coming out of my mouth. And I couldn’t help but laugh. </span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">About a month later, I knocked on their door only to find Celine home.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Jacques had some business to do,” she said, leaning against the doorframe. “But, you should come in.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh,” I said. “Alright then.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiled, grabbed me by the wrist and started to lead me to the couch. “He won’t be back until late, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stopped walking and stared at her. “I can always come back.” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“But why?” Celine frowned, tugging a little. “Do you not want to spend time with me?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No, it’s not that. I just,” I hesitated. “It seems a little inappropriate that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What does?” She was playing dumb. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You’re married.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She lifted an eyebrow. “And?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Look, I’m flattered. Really, I am,” I started, pulling my hand back. “It’s just that I respect Jacques and—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Celine smirked and moved my hand to the back of her waist. “Don’t be silly. You don’t respect him. You just respect the idea of him. If only you knew what he’s done.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Celine, look—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No,” she pulled me closer and looked straight into my eyes. “You look. I’m not asking for anything he hasn’t done already.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My blood went cold. “And by this, you mean—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She leaned in close to my ear. “Where do you think he is now?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m sorry, I had no idea,” I breathed out. She was warm against my body. “I can’t imagine what that feels like.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Then, why won’t you show me?” Her hands crawled closer to my neck, weighing me down to her level.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt the gap between us closing, drawing into her like a moth to the light. But in a split second, she was on the floor and I was already halfway out the door. My instinct acted quicker than my mind, the dirtiness of the situation leaving me with a feeling of grime all over my body. I could hear her calling out my name before I shut myself in my apartment, trying to scrub my soiled conscience in the shower until the water turned brown. </span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I couldn’t bring myself to tell Jacques about Celine’s advances, not when I knew what he had done to her. I guess I romanticized their relationship more than I thought which was more or less a wakeup call for me. It indicated that I was spending far too much of my free time as their pet. I started going to their apartment less often, started declining their invitations, and started avoiding any interaction, even the little ones. Quite frankly, I just went out less and instead, burrowed myself into my apartment like a hermit.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">One Friday evening, I heard a knock on my door. A wave of fear surged through my body, although I wasn’t exactly sure why. I debated pretending I wasn’t home, simply to dodge confrontation, but my lights were on and my footsteps were far too heavy for a ghost. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I took a collecting breath and opened the door. To my surprise, it was just Jacques. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Hey. Long time no see.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Yeah,” I scratched the back of my head. “It’s been a second, hasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He kind of peeked his head in. “Can I come in?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It’s kind of messy—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I don’t mind,” he cut in. “Really, I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Well,” I said. “Come on in then.” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Your place is really nice,” he commented, probably just trying to be polite. “I don’t know why we don’t hang out here more.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I forced out a laugh and just loitered close to a wall awkwardly, not exactly knowing what to say. His back was turned to me and I could hear him sigh. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Celine told me—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Jacques, it wasn’t what you think it is.” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I know,” he said. “You rejected her.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Oh. Well,” I hesitated. “I think of you highly.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I know you’ve been… accordingly distant to the both of us,” Jacques turned to face me. “But it’s not what you think it is.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m sorry. I don’t think I’m following,” I told him. “I’m slightly confused as to what you’re getting at.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Celine and I… it’s okay if we see other people. We’re in an open relationship.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stared at him blankly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m sorry, we probably should have mentioned it sooner. And even more than that, I’m sorry we made you feel uncomfortable. Celine thought she was reading you right, that’s all,” he let out a tentative laugh. “I mean, I was sure you were into her.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“It would have been nice of you to mention this to me before.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I guess it just slipped my mind,” he said. “Really, I’m sorry about all of this. Celine and I just miss you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I shifted my weight to one foot. “Alright then. Is that all?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jacques gave me a pained look. “Hey, didn’t you have fun with us the past couple of weeks? Wouldn’t it be a shame to become strangers?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“That was before you kept secrets from me,” I told him straight. “I can’t help but think, what else are you hiding?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;“We aren’t trying to hide anything from you. I promise that we just want it to go back to the way it was before.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Which is?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“You, me, and Celine, just a couple of adults having fun together,” he said. Jacques rubbed his forehead and hesitated. “Look, you’re… Celine and I never had any real friends before. Not any like you. And we just want to get this right. You’re obviously a great guy and I would just hate to see you not in our life anymore because of our stupid little slip up.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I’ll be honest, I was a bit touched at this point. Jacques looked so genuine and I swore that I saw a tear form in the inner corner of one of his eyes. I’d been playing hard to get because quite frankly, I was hurt and a little confused as to why they would keep such pertinent information from me. The way he was looking at me, pleading silently with those eyes, told me that he was nothing less than genuine. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Please don’t keep anything like that from me again,” I said finally. “It was hard avoiding you, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">He pulled me in for a hug and a fuzzy sensation spread through my body. “I’m glad we can move past this and continue on our path of friendship. Plus, it’s perfect timing. I have something fun planned for tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">・・・</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“What is that?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I squinted at the dropper in Celine’s hand. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c7">“They call it, get this: sage of the diviners,” she wiggled an eyebrow. “</span><span class="c2">Salvia divinorum.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“So, drugs.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“Oh, come on,” Celine rolled her eyes. “Live a little. A tiny drop won’t hurt anybody.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">I crossed my arms. “You say that…” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“Don’t be a prude. It’s harmless.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“Isn’t that illegal on Earth?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jacques shrugged. “ All that matters is that it’s legal on Mars.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">I glanced at their expressions, equal parts eager and judgemental. We weren’t exactly on rocky terms, but I sensed there was some tension between them and I. My guess was they wanted to loosen the high-strung environment with something that would guarantee an artificial sense of connection. I didn’t want to be the one to ruin all the fun, but I still wasn’t too sold on it. I had previously had a bad experience with hallucinogens and never touched one since. Maybe with the right people it wouldn’t be as bad, but my instincts told me to not. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“I don’t know. I’m not one to use.” I shoved my clammy hands into my pockets.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“We’ve done it a million times,” Jacques pressed. “Trust me, it’s safe. We’d never do anything that would make you sick.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“It’ll be fun,” Celine said, waving the bottle. She handed it to Jacques. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">I knew they weren’t going to give up so I just shrugged. “I guess I’m down. This is all we’ll do though, right?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c5">“Yeah. It’s a quick trip, an hour tops.” Jacques </span><span class="c5">pointed the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;dropper towards my mouth. “Open up.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">He put three drops in my mouth and then gave himself some. The cool liquid melted on to my tongue. It had kind of a minty taste to it, reminiscent of toothpaste and it made my mouth feel like it had been stuffed with cotton after a few swallows. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“When does it kick?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2">“Five minutes,” Celine said, giving herself two. “Relax. It’s gonna be amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="c0 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p>
