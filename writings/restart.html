            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Malcolm opens his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">It’s bright outside, sunlight peeking in through the cracks of the asymmetrical curtains to leave a shadowed pattern on the right side of his face. He looks up and meets eyes with another, someone who he recognizes as Xera. Malcolm doesn’t understand why he can, but he does. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You’re awake,” Xera says, a placid smile stretching through the width of her face. “Good morning, Malcolm.” </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Good morning,” he finds himself repeating. Xera’s grin only grows. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“How are you feeling?” The other tilts her head to the side. “You were knocked out for quite some time. I wasn’t sure if you were going to wake up anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“I’m fine,” Malcolm says, gaze never wavering. “Simply… hungry.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2">He breaks their prolonged stare to glance at his fingers, uncurling slowly only to curl them back into tight fists. They’re spotless, but something tells him that they weren’t like this before. Malcolm pauses, realizing that he doesn’t know what </span><span class="c2 c4">before</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;even means. Before </span><span class="c2 c4">what</span><span class="c0">? </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Where am I?” he questions out loud. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Malcolm watches Xera’s lips turn into a frown, but only for a split second, as she inches closer. Slowly, she takes Malcolm’s face into the palms of her hands as if the other could break like porcelain, dainty cherub features creased in worry. It feels pious—feels like he’s looking up at some sort of divine being. Her touch certainly feels like it. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Did you forget?” Xera asks tentatively, finger pads smoothing over his cheeks. “Again?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Malcolm’s cheeks heat up, almost like he’s ashamed. “Forget?” </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The delicate features twist into an ugly snarl for a moment too long. Xera sighs, removing her hand from Malcolm’s face. He still feels the imprint of where it had been. “Faulty trial. I have to start over, don’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Start over—”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Don’t worry about it, Mal,” Xera cuts in with an edge to her voice. “I’ll see what I can do.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“No, I remember, Xera,” he finds himself saying, words coming out of his mouth before he even had time to process them. “I remember so don’t worry. Please. Please don’t… I remember.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other’s face lights up, sparkles forming in her eyes. “You do?” </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“Of course, darling,” he says. “Of course.” </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xera inches closer, so that they’re only a breath away from each other. It’s strange—he can feel Xera on top of him, living and breathing, but he can’t even find it in himself to inhale or exhale. It’s something that irks him the wrong way, slowly ebbing away from the other. The silence consumes the room alive. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What’s wrong? I thought everything was… settled,” Xera’s eyes glow red in the direct sunlight. “Wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wave of nausea floods him, but it still feels contrived. It doesn’t feel real. Malcolm’s hands shake for the first time, jolting sporadically. “What—what did you do to me?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“You’ve too quick,” Xera says sweetly, voice on the verge of a purr. “Again. I’m afraid we’re going to have to cut this a little short.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">“What?” Malcolm asks. “Cut what—”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">Xera watches with careful eyes as the other collapses into the bed, springs creaking for a split second before the noise stills. She gets off the bed, the bottom of her feet cold against the floor. She stares out at the cerulean sky and rubs the creases of her forehead. Her computer blinks, text cursor waiting for her touch. So she leans in and presses enter.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c2">And Malcolm opens his eyes.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p>
