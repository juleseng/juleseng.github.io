            <h3 id="main">sisters are for others</h3>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there weren’t so many temptations </span><span class="c1">in the world</span><span class="c1">, things might have ended up differently. My sister would be inclined to agree, or at least I’d like to think so. After all, we were quite close before she escaped </span><span class="c1">the unbearable Arizona heat for </span><span class="c2 c1">Swarthmore College. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Good luck,” I said to her. Watched her skinny arms lift the luggage out of the car. “I’m always in your corner.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She just smiled.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I meant to check in with her at some point, but things got busy and we lost contact over the course of the autumn semester. Me, consumed by college applications and pendulum-like grades, and her, settling into that new life </span><span class="c1">of hers</span><span class="c2 c1">. I didn’t think too much of it until our father had brought up the question of her coming back for winter break, both him and I expecting her to tell us a date, eager to have someone other than each other in our hollowed, empty house but instead were given a single word: “Can’t.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She was always funny, but never funny like that. There was nothing that couldn’t be done or undone. She should have known that more than anyone. That single word irked me and my throat felt raw for the following few days. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I was curious as to what made college so grand for her, enough to abandon me back home. Swarthmore became a mild obsession of mine, but one that I never mentioned to her. Somewhat out of a fear of retaliation and somewhat out of a sick pleasure, knowing something that she didn’t. Something she couldn’t do anything about.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The mystic air surrounding her college drew out my unbridled curiosity and I couldn’t, nor did I want to, stay away. I submitted my application one Tuesday morning and prayed.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The news of my acceptance came first. I was delighted and spent the day pacing my room with the local alternative rock station blasting from my computer speakers and thinking of ways I could tell my sister that I would be on campus with her next fall. The two of us, together again. I recited my words over and over again, trying different tones and cadences, wanting to find the perfect medium between uninterested and happenstance.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">A call from the administration came the morning after. My sister was found in her dorm room, with one of our father’s ties wrapped around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2 c1">My father couldn’t bear to fly us out to Pennsylvania, instead opting to ship the body and all of her belongings directly home. She didn’t have much stuff. Everything from her college life fit neatly in three medium-sized cardboard boxes. There wasn’t even a note. Something about that made me sick, rotten to my core. I suddenly felt detached from her, like I hadn’t known her my whole life. And maybe I didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">There were no comments made when I decided to go to Swarthmore. By then, my father had become a shell of a human, more than he was before. I suppose it’s because he never really loved me and I never really loved him, both of us knowing and accepting this unconditionally. So I guess he truly didn’t have anybody left.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">After her death, I tried to find clues of why she did what she had done. I tore apart those boxes and spiral notebooks trying to search for some semblance of an explanation. Some letter, or code to me. She was sly like that. But most of it was philosophical garbage from her classes. Nietzsche, Kant, all that bullshit. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My sister had always been a private person. It was because of this behavior that I sought out a way to connect to her removed from our gridlocked conversations. When I was thirteen, I had found her diary, disguised as an old math notebook buried within her underwear drawer. She was much more clever than she had ever led me to believe and the thought of that made my head float. I read her diary like it was the Bible, memorizing every detestable detail until it consumed me. A few days later, she left me a creased corner pointing to my name. This was the start of our play, our halcyon age.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She was never impulsive, which meant that every move up until her death was premeditated. In some sick way, I wondered if our last conversation on the phone had been part of her decision, if she even thought of me. After all, it was right before the incident. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I had called her spontaneously in the dead of night because I was feeling ill as the application season was coming to a crux, expecting her monotonous voicemail to blare back at me. She had a bad habit of not answering my calls, but would always leave some short voicemail to sate my worries. As the dial tone rang, I dozed off, trying to think of what I would say, what I wanted to say to get her to call me back, but then she picked up. There was a certain breathiness on the other line that made my hands go numb.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Hello?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">My brain short-circuited. “Oh, hi. Is this a bad time?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">There was a cacophony of static. “I’m so glad you called me back.” I heard some muffled talking. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She didn’t respond for a few beats. I called her name, then again. I could hear her breathing and the rustle of leaves. I shivered.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You gave me a ring at the perfect time.” Her voice sounded loopy. It echoed in my ear. “Always looking out for your sister, hm?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Are you drunk?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“No.” A dampened laugh.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Is something wrong?” I asked, a tightening feeling crawling up my throat. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“No,” she said. “Nothing is wrong. I just needed to get out of this horticulture thing.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Must have been bad.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She was silent on the other end. Then, a laugh. I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding in. “Everything’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Alright,” I said. “Don’t push yourself.” She went quiet but I knew she was smiling through the phone. Then, the dial tone. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Perhaps I was too occupied with myself during this time to realize the strangeness of our last phone call.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;I was irked by her eagerness to escape a situation, and moreso, the awkwardness of what she was escaping from. Horticulture. It wasn’t a familiar word in my vocabulary and I knew it wasn’t in hers either. At least in the sister that I knew.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I desired her—the idea of her, the flesh of her, the harrowing presence of her—more than anything. Now more than ever. In those moments before her death, was she different from what I remembered? Her long black hair, those snake-like hazel eyes, and a mouth that was always curved mysteriously, like she knew your cruelest, darkest </span><span class="c1">thought</span><span class="c1">. She was a spitting image of our dead mother and my father loved her very much. I did too. So I held to these fragmented memories of her like it was my lifeline.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">My roommate, Aria, was a sophomore from </span><span class="c1 c6 c3">Chappaqua</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and dead set on getting a job in investment banking. She had yellow blonde curls and nothing interesting to </span><span class="c1">say</span><span class="c1">. When I had told her </span><span class="c2 c1">I was undecided and taking a random load of classes that didn’t even fill my general education requirements, she gave me a tight-lipped smile. We rarely spoke after that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Our sides of the room looked very different. She had flimsy decorations and pictures with family and friends. Those cheap Christmas lights casting a warm hue along the borders of her ceiling. There was nothing that I wanted to take from home, except for my sister’s old wushu broadsword, which I positioned above the headboard of my bed as some memorial to her. If you could call it that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was in the bathroom when I first met Dana during Orientation Week. She was brushing </span><span class="c2 c1">her teeth, foamy mouth dripping onto the side of the sink like a dog with rabies. Kind of looked like one too with her beady eyes and upturned nose.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You’re a freshman, huh?” She spat out the rest of her toothpaste concoction. It was bright blue and almost stained her yellowing teeth.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Yeah.” I was rather uninterested.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I can tell because of the way you walk.” I didn’t know what she meant by that, but it made my back straighten a bit. “Where are you from?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Phoenix,” I said, wiping off my eyeliner. It stung.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">There was a lull. “Well, I’m from ‘round here. So if you have any questions about going into Philly or Swarthmore in general, I’m your girl.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I stared at her in the mirror. “Thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She picked at the gap between her two front teeth and turned to me. “</span><span class="c1">You do acid?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The feeling wasn’t what I thought it would be. My breath slowed, that’s what I noticed first. Then, her room started to move, hued with orange and purple lights. A feeling of numbness spread throughout my body. Felt it especially on my tongue.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I started to wonder if I had made a mistake, if I was even in the right state of mind to be taking this many tabs, on my first trip too, but then the walls started to pulse and breathe alongside me and all I could do was laugh stupidly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She called out my name.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What?” My mouth was dry. “Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Let’s go outside.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I remembered her grabbing my arm and the feeling of her clammy palms on my forearm made my stomach churn, but I focused on the trails of lights following me and stumbled across whatever lawn she was taking me to, next to some dome-shaped building. Everything was moving.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The grass was a bit damp and it felt cool against my skin. I closed my eyes for a second and suddenly, something wet licked at my lips.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What the fuck?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Dana’s face was contorted in this real ugly way. Her eyes were huge. “Don’t ruin the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Moment?” My head was spinning. I tried to push myself away from her, but everything kept coming closer. Like a dolly zoom. I could see the peach fuzz on her face in the moonlight. That scared me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Just enjoy it.” She grabbed my face again and mashed it against hers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I felt my body contort with an unrestrained squirm, moving slow and fast at the same time, and I was ready to scream, wanted to scream, but I couldn’t for some reason and that alone made me stop breathing. Her wet hands pressed against my cheeks, the condensation of her sweat dirtying me and it made me want to claw at my skin until raw and I realized my eyes had been dizzyingly tightened shut the entire time, so I opened my eyes, wide and wider.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Out of the corner, I saw her, not Dana, but my sister, my dead sister, but she was alive and smiling and had that Christian Lacroix tie, the one that we had gotten for our father on his 49th birthday, the one that she had taken all the credit for, draped around her neck and like always, she had that conniving grin, that one that I loved and hated, smeared across her beautiful face. I could feel her fingers on my jaw, stroking up, cold and dead. I thought she was going to kill me, kill me right then and there because sisters like us, we were always meant to be together. My throat churned and I let out a breathy shriek.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">And just like that, the weight on top of me was gone. A breeze curled underneath my shirt and tickled my back. I looked up to see a pale-faced, albino girl with glowing hair staring down, but not at me. Her lips looked like they had been stained by cherries.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“There’s a lot of noise out here.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I wiped my mouth, a trail of blood swiping across the back of my hand. Swallowed the metallic taste. Dana let out a pathetic, “Fuck, sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The girl only frowned. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Dana’s eyes were wet, dripping, and I thought mine might be too. “You don’t understand. We gotta go.” She gripped my wrist, tethering herself to me like a chain.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I don’t want to.” The words slipped off my numb tongue before I could properly think them. “Not with you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Does it look like I care?” </span><span class="c2 c1">Dana’s face cornered mine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You can leave,” the girl said to Dana, eyes dead. “You’re frightening her.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dana stumbled up and gave me one last glance. She seemed like she was going to piss herself, right then and there, and the thought of that made me laugh. I laughed until she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I looked up to the girl and gave her my best, curated smile. There was something magnetic about her and I found myself wanting to touch her translucent skin. The veins in her arms seemed to pulsate and glow in the darkness of the night. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She didn’t respond. Air reached down my throat and grabbed my breath like a reckless invader. She wouldn’t look at me, and that made me attracted towards her. Something in my stomach dropped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What’s your name?” I stayed smiling, placatingly. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The girl glimpsed in my direction. “Marlowe.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I looked around, suddenly hyper aware of my surroundings. The building next to us, a greenhouse, seemed alive, moving to the tempo of my own heartbeat. Only a small, red light on the other side of the circumference illuminated the space. I felt a pang in my chest. “Where am I?” I furrowed my brows, clutching onto bunches of grass to anchor myself. It felt slippery between my fingers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Outside of our greenhouse. The Horticulture Club’s.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">A feeling of euphoria rushed to my head. Maybe God was looking out for me after all. She looked like God herself.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Did she know my sister? I wanted to ask</span><span class="c1">, but that felt rash. This moment had to be anything but that.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I told her my name and asked if I could join.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Join?” Her eyes met mine for the first time. She lifted an eyebrow. “We aren’t accepting any new members.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Her chin was lifted slightly and I could see a birthmark hidden in the crease of her porcelain skin. I suddenly felt conscious of how I looked, the wetness of the grass seeping into my skin through my corduroy pants. A distorted feeling of humiliation inflamed in my throat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You’d benefit from having me in the club,” I found myself saying. “I’m incredibly loyal to the things I love the most.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“When did I ever say anything about loyalty?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">A flurry of heat torched my insides. “You didn’t. I did.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marlowe looked amused. That left a tingling sensation on my cheeks. “We have enough members.” T</span><span class="c2 c1">hen, she shrugged. “But if you insist.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I do,” I said fervently. It felt pious. “I really do.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Your dedication seems to be a wonderful thing,” she said, her pointer finger poking at my forehead. It was cold and I relished the feeling in the heat of the night. “Doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I was told to go to the greenhouse the next day. I knocked on the door and when no one answered, went in. On the other side of the greenhouse, Marlowe had gloves on and was clipping a bonsai tree. She was wearing a long black dress and had her hair pulled tightly into a bun. Something inside of me burned. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">There were three other people next to her, lazily watching her trim. I walked closer to them, but none of them turned their attention to me. </span><span class="c1">Marlowe held the scissors delicately. A snip here, a snip there. </span><span class="c2 c1">Almost rhythmic. Every move looked calculated and planned. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The girl on the left of her had shiny black hair that went down to her tailbone with every contour of her body emphasized by her skin-tight black getup. The one on the right had dreads that stopped just below her breasts. She had earbuds in, music on the highest setting, and I could hear faintly what she was listening to. Cocteau Twins.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">There was only one boy. His glasses covered most of his face, although they couldn’t hide his purpled eyebags. He was the first to notice me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Hi there,” he smiled. It was rather charming. “You’re our newest member, right?” He introduced himself as Max, and the two girls as Indigo and Tia, respectively. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I nodded. The other two glanced in my direction. Indigo’s eyes glittered. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Do you know anything about horticulture?” Indigo asked, pulling out a Marlboro. She leaned into Max, who lit the cig for her. </span><span class="c1">It felt like she was asserting dominance. </span><span class="c2 c1">“I’m surprised that Marlowe invited you.” She blew a ring of smoke.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe put down her scissors, darkened eyes focused on me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I had spent the summer studying various books like Simon Schama’s </span><span class="c1 c9">Landscape and Memory</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that I had found in my sister’s boxes in preparation for something like this. </span><span class="c1">It wasn’t that I didn’t find the material interesting, but I had to wonder how my sister had gotten involved with the club itself. </span><span class="c2 c1">Back home in Scottsdale, we were surrounded by the dry, arid desert and more than that, nothing that would ever spark an interest towards a green thumb. She had never mentioned wanting to do any sort of work with plants. It seemed odd for her to seek out a niche, rather dull activity like this. I couldn’t even imagine how she got involved with these people in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">They all were staring at me now. I took an indulgent breath and gave them my memorized monologue. I had spent a great deal trying to structure it so that it felt natural, like I had been an expert in horticulture for years.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Well,” Max said. A brief, tense pause. Only Tia’s muffled music filled the silence. “You might know more about it than me.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Wonderful.” Marlowe gave me a small, affirming smile. “Then let’s have some tea.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tea was not tea and I wanted to vomit. It was tea, but not the tea that I thought it would be, the kind that I wanted. It was something called Ayahuasca and it made my stomach churn. The four of them seemed fine. I was the only one suffering.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Do you feel alright?” Indigo asked. She was sitting on Max’s lap. Her hair looked like it would consume her. “You don’t look good at all.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I’m fine,” I breathed out. “Totally fine.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Tia, who still had her headphones in, put her hand on my shoulder as if to tell me to calm down. It only made me more nauseous. She had this sickly-sweet perfume on, the one that all of the expensive girls at my high school used to wear just to get fucked by old men who were their dad’s age.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I breat</span><span class="c1 c3">hed out through my mouth and sniffed. Some unintelligible muttering waned in and out. The </span><span class="c1 c3 c6">bromeliads</span><span class="c1 c3">&nbsp;seemed to be talking to me. I could feel their breath on the back of my neck. It was like they were on th</span><span class="c2 c1">e edge of telling me something but couldn’t. That made me paranoid and more nauseous than before. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I focused on Marlowe, who had her eyes closed and was leaning back into her chair. She looked rather regal with the sunlight obstructing her face at all the right angles. I tried to center myself on her to calm down. The sharpness of her cheekbones. Her long white lashes. White eyebrows. White hair. Pale lips parted. She almost looked dead.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Her eyelids fluttered open and our eyes met. Heat rose to my cheeks, embarrassed that I had been caught, but she didn’t look away, she kept her gaze locked on me and suddenly, my entire body prickled. Self-immolation.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe shut her eyes slowly as if she were orgasming, mouth parted slightly. The warmth only burned harder. I closed my eyes, as if to mimic her.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">They didn’t contact me for three days. I mostly spent the time in bed, glazed in a drunken stupor which I guessed was due to withdrawals from the tea. I sweated through my sheets and left a sticky dampness trail in my stead. When I was lucid enough, I would think of my sister. How I had failed where she had succeeded and how she was able to get into the club and couldn’t. Something about that made me anxious and I chewed into my nails compulsively until they exposed my pink, raw skin. I was picking the dried blood off when Tia showed up at my dorm door. Slowdive filled the empty space through her oversized headphones.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Hi,” I said. I didn’t know why I was expecting the worst, but I held my breath anyway. She grabbed my hand and started to lead me out of the room before I jerked back instinctively. With a tilt of her head to the side, almost condescendingly, I got the sense that I wasn’t supposed to resist.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Her lips were covered in a shiny gloss, almost like they were made of glass. I couldn’t count how many layers of clothes she was wearing, some wife beater with a webbed, pistachio sweater over it, only covering one of her breasts and body jewelry that connected to her navel. I looked down at my dirty clothes and stiffened. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Can you give me a second?” I asked. Tia nodded, but didn’t budge from the doorframe. Instead, she took a seat at my desk and stared openly. Shamelessly. I was flustered, but I tried not to show it. The only other girl I remembered changing in front of frequently had been my sister. Our little ritual went like this: I would sit in front of the vanity and she would hold the sides of my waist, and then comb through my hair with her fingers. With Tia watching me, this felt like some invasion of our little secret.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I slowly stripped myself of my sweats, awkwardly shuffling on a pair of jeans and buttoning on a blouse. My hair was knotted in the back so I brushed it straight and put it in a low ponytail that hung right below my shoulder blades. Tia’s presence made me feel strangely vulnerable, like the object of a voyeur. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Once I was finished, Tia led me silently to the greenhouse. She didn’t go in with me, waiting by the doorframe once I was noticed by Indigo, who was wrangling some leaves into a grandiose display, and then left. Indigo stopped to nudge Marlowe, who had her back facing me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I’m so glad you could join us,” Marlowe said, putting down an overgrown, unruly bonsai on the main table. “I would have retrieved you myself if I hadn’t had a shipment coming in.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Oh.” My mouth felt taut. “It’s okay.” I didn’t know what else to say.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe smiled, a bit sympathetic. A bit indulgent. She had the smallest triangular gap between her two front teeth. “I should have reached out sooner, but things just got a bit busy.” She paused. “You weren’t waiting on our call or anything, I hope.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I stilled, though I didn’t know why. Marlowe was looking at me, staring at me with those clouded eyes of hers, and I felt as though I was frozen in time. Frozen in her trance. I could only manage a robotic shake of the head.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Indigo let out a laugh. “Marlowe’s just teasing.” The other just shrugged in response and dusted soil off one of the bonsai’s branches. “What matters is that you’re here now, right?” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I thought she was asking a rhetorical question, but then she lifted a sharp eyebrow up at me expectantly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Right.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I religiously went to the greenhouse </span><span class="c1">for the next few weeks</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c1">drinking the tea on occasion, which I acclimated to after more sessions</span><span class="c2 c1">, and learning about each of their specialties. Marlowe with her bonsai. Indigo, a master of ikebana. Tia took care of all the exotic plants in the greenhouse and managed the small zen garden east of the greenhouse. And Max fronted most of the dirty work, fertilizer, watering, and potting. I found him in the greenhouse one day with three live carps, flailing in a small tank he was peering at intensely. Maybe they knew what was going to happen to them.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn’t, so I asked. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Fish guts are one of the best natural fertilizers out there,” he explained. His glasses were perched low on his nose. “I don’t know if three is enough. I should have gotten four.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Do you need help?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">He lifted an eyebrow. “Usually girls are squeamish about this kind of stuff. At least, Indigo is.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">His eyes were fully dilated. I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">lifted my sleeve</span><span class="c2 c1">. “I can help.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">He let out a hearty, pleasing laugh. “Of course you can.” He pulled out a net from the cabinet and fished out a resistant carp on to the table. Its green scales glinted and its mouth gasped for air. Asphyxiated. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;He handed me the cleaver and I found myself holding my breath. I watched the fish struggle, watched the gills pulsate with desperation. </span><span class="c1">Why was it straining itself to live?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;More than anything, I envied it. </span><span class="c1">The tail flapped on the table, like a metronome. I saw my reflection in the darkness of its eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Are you going to—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before he could finish, I slammed the cleaver down. The struggle stopped. Max let out a small curse. I looked down at the carnage and then, at the two living carps, waiting for their fate. There was blood all over my new silk blouse, but all I could do was exhale. A sweetness on the tip of my tongue, a feeling of exhilaration. I reached for the </span><span class="c1">net</span><span class="c2 c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You seem to be blending in well with the club.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You think so?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Yes. I’m glad you approached me that day.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Well, technically, you did.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I was with Marlowe alone, in her off-campus cabin, five minutes from campus. Even so, there wasn’t another house in sight. Only the dark canopy of trees surrounded </span><span class="c1">us</span><span class="c1">. It felt lonely, </span><span class="c1">in the kind of right way. </span><span class="c1">She had let me stay the night after dinner, </span><span class="c1">something that seemed to be happening more frequently. At first it had been because it was too late in the night to walk back when we talked into the hours of dawn, but it soon became an expectation for me to stay. We never talked about my sister, mostly because I could never find the right time to bring it up. I wanted to, but Marlowe and I would get so immersed in some subject material that I found myself not wanting to ruin the mood. I </span><span class="c2 c1">swirled the wine in my glass and watched the dark burgundy color run up the sides, then slip down.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Was it now?” Marlowe raised her eyebrow. She leaned in closer, and I could feel some of her stray hairs tickling my cheek.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I held my breath. “It’s all thanks to you.</span><span class="c1">”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Right.” She smiled. I could smell the wine on her breath and my mouth instinctively watered. She leaned back into the couch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe was effortlessly pretty. Graceful, in a way that couldn’t be taught. She didn’t wear any makeup, didn’t have to, and smelled of subtle, floral perfume—hyacinth. I watched her pull back her hair into a low bun. My palms sweated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Want to learn how to cut?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I nodded and glanced over to the current tree, a Japanese Maple, she was working on. It was still rather shaggy, overgrown branches, but the core feminine shape was there. That was her flair. The voluptuous curvatures of a woman, always present in her work.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She picked up a pair of gloves out of a drawer and handed them to me. “Try these on.” </span><span class="c1">They felt smooth on my skin and something about the fact that they were her gloves excited me.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">We moved to the tree. Marlowe stood behind me, small scissors in hand. She placed them in my palm. “I’ll guide you,” she said. </span><span class="c1">Her lips were close to my neck. </span><span class="c2 c1">“We want to create a rounded shape right there.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I swallowed. She gently took my gloved hand into hers and moved it toward the lowest branch. “Here,” she said. “Cut.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Shreds of leaves fell to the ground. I looked down.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Your first snip,” she said. I couldn’t see her face. “How did it feel?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Good,” I said hoarsely.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Good.” She guided the scissors upward and pressed her body into my back, so that I was almost leaning into the blades of the scissors and tree. My insides were on fire. “Because there’s no going back.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I ran into Dana</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;in the dining hall a few weeks later. I was going to ignore her, but she called out my name, and there were too many people looking at us for me to turn away.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I haven’t seen you around,” she said. </span><span class="c2 c1">Her tray consisted of three twinkies and a bowl of Froot Loops, no milk. “Aria says you’re never in your room.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Who?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She looked at me, deadpan. “Your roommate. In the dorm you live in.” I had been crashing in Marlowe’s spare room almost daily, </span><span class="c1">although sometimes I drifted to her bed when the room got too cold.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;She would let me in, no questions asked. Sometimes she held me in her arms. I savored the feeling of her wrapped around me, the softness of her skin. It reminded me of my sister’s. But like clockwork, I would wake up to an empty bed. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I heard you’re in that club, or whatever.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What does it mean to you?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Dana let out a shrill laugh. “A girl who hung around them last year killed herself. You want to end up like her?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I clenched my jaw. “You’re sick.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“No, no—they’re the sick ones,” she said. “</span><span class="c1">You’re just too drugged up to see it.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“They’re good people,” I told her. “Unlike you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Sure, whatever, you can think of me however you like. I’m that big, horrible bitch who you had a bad trip with. Blame me all you want. But I’m warning you, they’re bad news.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“They’re my friends.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Friends.” She popped a single Froot Loop in her mouth. “Drink the Kool-Aid more, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Go fuck yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn’t quite understand the club’s infamous reputation on campus. It seemed to me that people hated its exclusivity, although it occurred to me that I was part of that problem. Not that I particularly cared what they all thought. Even so, my conversation with Dana bothered me to a point where I started making excuses to Marlowe to sleep in my dorm instead of her spare. I found it hard to face her when t</span><span class="c1">he thought of my sister made my bones hurt and I spent my nights hallucinating her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Right when I would fall asleep, she would sit over me. </span><span class="c1">Thighs compressing my neck</span><span class="c2 c1">. She would stare down at me and reach for her broadsword’s blade and point the tip right at my crux of head. She would never say anything, not that she had to. I could see it in her eyes, that satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">You still love me the most, they seemed to say. Raison d'etre.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I wanted to scream at her to get off, to tell her that I didn’t need her anymore, but she knew the answer to that more than anyone. It reminded me of a time at her sixteenth birthday party, when she had pulled me into the kitchen, away from all the attendees who were in the main room. Her hand felt cold in mine.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I hate them all,” she had said, digging around the cabinet. “Everyone’s fake. Happy birthday—yeah, fuck you. Can see right through </span><span class="c1">them.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“More of a networking party for him than a celebration for you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">My sister looked pleased. “Exactly. Good thing that there’s a plus to that.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She opened the freezer and pulled out a bottle of tequila, waving it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“That shit is disgusting,” I had told her, wrinkling my nose. I could already taste it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She unscrewed the cap and took one of our father’s champagne flutes. “Don’t be such a prude.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I’m not a prude.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">A laugh. She poured herself a drink. “No, you kind of are. You never want to drink or do anything when the boys come over.” I wanted to point out that I always ended up drinking anyways, but she wouldn’t care. Everything was about intentions to her.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I don’t like them.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“The boys?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I pressed my lips together. “Boys.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She paused, as if she had been waiting for a moment like this for a long time, then smiled. Suddenly, the room felt a lot smaller. I thought she was going to say something, but she didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I cleared my throat. “Anyways, I’ll drink. Not a prude.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Right,” she had said coyly, raising her glass. “Won’t believe it until I see it. Cheers to us.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I stuck out my tongue and downed the drink in one go. It burned my throat and I coughed over the sink afterwards. When I turned </span><span class="c1">back</span><span class="c2 c1">, her eyes were darkened. Burning.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“You always do everything I say.” She dangled her flute from her slender fingers. “You never say no.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her fingers moved from the stem of the flute to the bowl, then crushed the glass in one swift movement. The muffled conversations from the main room stopped. She looked at the mess in her hand, glittering blood-covered shards slipping through her fingertips and plinking on the ground like raindrops, and smiled tautly. “See,” she had said. The sound of footsteps, impending. “This is what it feels like to love you.”</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">But she had gotten it backwards. That was what it was like to love her.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I couldn’t find any evidence that my sister existed in the Horticulture Club except for that off-handed comment from Dana. A tabula rasa. No mention of her name, or presence in the ledgers. Like I had hallucinated it, though I know I didn’t.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I felt sick to my stomach, scrambling behind Marlowe’s back to find something perverse and when left empty-handed, feeling even sicker than before. My sister’s face felt obstructed in my mind, blurred features, blurred beauty. And her personality. The sharpness started to round and cleverness started to dull. Something felt wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">On a Sunday evening at the greenhouse, I decided to ask Marlowe.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“There was a girl last year.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe was trimming one of her favorite trees, a Juniper. “Who?” A snip.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I heard she was in this club.” Another snip. “And that she committed suicide.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Okay.” Two snips. Then, Marlowe put her clippers on the table. She took off her gloves and let her hair down.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Do you know why?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe gave me a look. “Why would I?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I don’t know. Because she was in this club. And you’re all rather close.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She pondered for a second. “Why does anybody kill themselves?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I guess people are unhappy with their lives.”</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“So let them be unhappy.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Marlowe’s avoidance of my question made me feel uneasy. </span><span class="c1">I also wasn’t sure if my sister had been unhappy, not in the conventional sense at least. Everything she wanted, she got. </span><span class="c2 c1">To think she wanted to die—I couldn’t imagine it. I couldn’t justify it.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She put back on her gloves to signify that the conversation was over. She resumed her snipping. I looked over at Tia desperately. She was listening to Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, 3rd movement, and stared at me blankly. Like I had broken something I shouldn't have touched in the first </span><span class="c1">place</span><span class="c2 c1">. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">I found Max and Indigo in the greenhouse the next day. </span><span class="c1">The two were rather elusive, but almost always were together. Always touching like two lovesick teenagers.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">That day, Max was in charge of tidying up the greenhouse. He was carrying out all the clippings to the dumpster a few steps away, trudging through the muddied orange leaves that were starting to fall from the trees. I sat beside Indigo, in her signature tight black suit. She was watching Max with hawk eyes. I had asked Marlowe if they were dating, because it seemed rather obvious that they were, but she laughed at the idea, as if I were making the most ridiculous observation in the world.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I didn’t really like you at first,” Indigo told me as we watched Max drag one of the last garbage bags out of the greenhouse.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I couldn’t tell,</span><span class="c2 c1">” I said.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">She swatted my arm. “I don’t like most people. It was supposed to be a compliment.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Thanks, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“I’m serious,” she said. </span><span class="c1">“You’re much better than that bitch we had before.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Pursed lips and glazed eyes, tense with disdain, </span><span class="c1">as if she were recalling a memory that she wished she </span><span class="c1">hadn’t</span><span class="c2 c1">. “Who?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Oh.” Indigo kept her eyes on Max through the glass. “You know.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">“We didn’t like her too much. She couldn’t handle it.” There was a husk to her voice, a biting coldness.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">She stiffened. “Anyways, it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Handle what?” </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">My curiosity slipped through my tongue. I felt so close to the truth, I just needed a bit more. But then the air shifted and Indigo was looking at me, frowning. I held my breath as she scanned my entire face slowly, from the top of my forehead all the way down to the tip of my chin, as if she were memorizing every feature. Then, she looked back at Max, who gazed over at us through the obscured glass, and let out a delighted, satisfied laugh.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe and I had dinner at her place later that night. The steak we were eating was blue rare. Marlowe and the others had primarily meat-based diets, which was a bit odd considering their affinity towards plants. I cut into the steak, the bloodied juice pouring out. I had never liked the taste.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Why did you ask me that yesterday?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I paused, mid-bite. There was a mirror behind her and I could see part of my reflection, steak glistening in the light on my fork. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe looked at me delicately. “It was odd. Out of character for you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What is in character for me?” I laughed. She didn’t. I stopped.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Keeping your head down.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She was staring at me, but her eyes were dead. It reminded me of the first time we had met, the first time she had seen right through me. Like I was invisible. That feeling made me recoil back into myself</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c2 c1">I sipped the wine nervously, my fingers unable to keep a steady grip on the glass.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I don’t think I know the real you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I tried to keep a straight face. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe didn’t answer, just half-heartedly shrugged. It was silent for a beat, and then two. The tone of our conversation seemed to take a hard turn into something else, and I didn’t want to find out what it was.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Let’s talk about something else,” I tried. “I don’t feel well.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“What is there to talk about?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Everything,” I said. “Anything.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I want to talk about you. The real you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“This is the real me,” I said, a little desperately. “Not some game—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“Isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I opened and closed my mouth dumbly. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“A game to you,” she said, tracing the outline of her plate. “I thought you really cared for us, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">All of the feeling in my face went numb, as if I had been dunked into an ice bath.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I do,” I swallowed. The words felt heavy in my mouth, as if I had to manually lift up my tongue for every syllable. “I really care about you.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“No.” She closed her eyes, eyelashes pointed down. “You’re disloyal. Or maybe it was that you were never loyal in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I let out a shaky breath. Nothing felt worse than this. “Marlowe, please.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“We never did anything to her.” Her voice was strange. Calm. “She killed herself all on her own.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I never said you did, I just said—”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I know what you said.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The silence was deafening and a bassy sound flooded my eardrums, turning them hot and raw. It felt as if I was underwater, drowning in my own thick blood. I didn’t know what to say with her looking at me like that, knowing me like that and more importantly, didn’t know what she wanted me to say. My vision blurred and I felt as though I would pass out, a sickening feeling crawling up my throat and sliding down to my toes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“I just wanted to know,” I said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe got up from her chair and put her hands on my shoulders. I couldn’t see her face through the mirror, only myself, but watched as her hands smoothed over my hair. I couldn’t help but feel comforted in some blurred way. I wonder if she knew. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">“She died because she wanted to.” Marlowe’s breath was cool on my skin. I hadn’t realized that I had been burning up the entire time. “We just helped her realize it.”</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Slowly, Marlowe thumbed over my lips. I could taste blood on her skin and the thought of where it had come from made me shiver. I stared at myself through the mirror, but I couldn’t recognize the person staring back. And in some distorted way, I knew it was her. My sister. She was giving me that look, that coded smile of hers and I saw it in her twinkling, dark stare. I wondered what she would have wanted me to do. I wondered a lot of things, but then, I thought it was better not to think at all. I closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Marlowe’s hands slowly crawled from the back of my ears to my neck, icy fingers lightly lacing around my throat and exerting a pressure that was so subtle, I almost didn’t feel it. I leaned into the tightening feeling. The vulnerability, the control. I didn’t know if it was right to live this way, but I had never been concerned with what was right before.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">She</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;took my face into her cold hands and I presented my head devoutly.</span></p>
